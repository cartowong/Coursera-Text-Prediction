Here is why Wandry matters. Our current system imposes a gift tax of up to 35% when taxpayers give assets away, with exceptions. Individuals now get one $5.12 million lifetime exemption, and they can also give up to $13,000 of assets a year to an unlimited number of recipients. (Next year the lifetime break is scheduled to drop to $1 million and the top rate to rise to 55%.)

Gov.Martin O'Malley's proposal for a 6 percent sales tax on gas is a bad idea. With the current 23.5 cents per gallon tax, consumers are already struggling to make ends meet. When a Maryland citizen doesn't have enough money to pay his bills, he is forced to cut his spending and adjust his budget. As steward of the public treasury, the same standard should be applied to our governor.

It took all year to get the girl loosen up, but it was definitely worth the wait to get to this assertive, soulful reading of a Dusty Springfield classic served with sass we'd never seen from Cavanagh. She even shook her hips (if just a little) in a retro-tastic mini-dress and heels (both pink). Improving this much this late in the season almost makes you wonder if she meant to do that.
Part of the problem stems from Kadafi's oppressive identity politics. There was no reading, writing or singing in the Amazigh language, Tamazight.

New things arise all the time, and I don't think it will ever stop."
Day 2 of the draft was highlighted by plenty of risky business. They passed on several first-round opportunities to land more well-known pass-catching commodities in favor of a highly productive receiver from a smaller school who some draft analysts compare with a Terrell Owens. Then they followed that up with the selection of a couple of talented cornerbacks with potential character issues in Janoris Jenkins and Trumaine Johnson, which gives the Rams the rare distinction of being potentially the first team in NFL history to select two players in the same draft who have both been on the business end of a police stun gun.

Speaking of showing up, lots of Ducks fans at Staples Center on Sunday. Plenty of Blazers fans, too. Felt like a neutral-site game at times. Maybe they'd all been sucked in by the 3-0 start. Maybe they were just looking for something to do on the eve of the Rose Bowl. No doubt, what anyone who saw the game was served was a reminder that one furious quarter almost never erases three panicked ones.

I was eager to try the specialty olive stuffed naan ($4.95), a standout if you love green olives (or martinis). Owner Arun Puri said his wife developed the recipe a few years ago after watching her husband sip a martini. I loved the warm bits of chopped olives layered in the thin wheat bread. It tasted so fresh and wholesome but also bold with the salty olives. Normally, I like to dip the bread in sauces and dishes, but with this naan I wanted to savor every bite without embellishment. The kitchen also prepares an onion basil naan and naan stuffed with lamb or chicken.

Each side of the debate invokes its own favored study. Support for the "German hypothesis" comes from two Harvard economists with un-German names—Alberto Alesina and Silvia Ardagna. But their critics, who include Mr. Ball, say their sample includes many irrelevant episodes for which their model fails to correct—including, for example, the U.S. "fiscal correction" that was born out of the U.S. economic boom of the late 1990s.

The 6-foot-2, 205-pound Inns passed for 255 yards per game and 25 touchdowns this season, both tops in the NWC. Inns, who threw 10 passes in his first two years at Linfield, seamlessly replaced Boehme, a Division III second-team all-American in 2010.
øI'm feeling great! I'm obviously feeling blessed to be in the situation that we're in with the opportunity to play in another big game. You never want to take these games for granted because you never know if you're going to get the opportunity to get back to one in your career.

Karl Marx, denouncing the rich? Nah. The Republican Rough Rider himself, Theodore Roosevelt, in a 1906 message to Congress, the same "TR" who in 1912 handily carried Batchelder's beloved Medina County -- as a Bull Moose renegade from the GOP.
The combined company is projected to have 2012 annual revenues approaching $2 billion, which will make it the third-largest natural-foods grocer in the United States in terms of sales, said Carlotta Mast, editor in chief of Natural Foods Merchandiser, a trade publication based in Boulder, Colo.

-- "The Tao of Travel: Enlightenments from Lives on the Road" by Paul Theroux. Once you get past the jaw-dropping pretentiousness of calling a book "enlightenments from lives on the road" and then filling it mostly with quotes and passages cribbed from your other books, this is actually a pretty fun book. It's pretty much a bathroom reader (not meant to be read from front to back) with scores of passages and quips covering a host of travel themes. Get the leather soft cover in case you take it on the road. (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt; 304 pages; $25 list).
Trying to keep order in the small room, Dairsow pleaded with the children to not take out items until they were home, a request that was mostly ignored.

The dye is only a starting point. You also can dabble with texture and design. For a mottled effect, rub the dyed egg to remove some of the color before it is dry.
Obama's surge will bring to 51,000 his Afghanistan escalation since March. Supposedly this will buy time for Afghan forces to become adequate. But it is not intended to buy much time: Although the war is in its 98th month, Obama's "Mission Accomplished" banner will be unfurled 19 months from now -- when Afghanistan's security forces supposedly will be self-sufficient. He must know this will not happen.

government regulators haven't paid as much attention to Apple as they did to Microsoft during the 1990s and to Google during the past four years.
"Our approach against Moyer was just to try to see something over the plate and be aggressive, but not so aggressive on stuff that's falling off the edge of the plate," Dodgers right fielder Andre Ethier said. "There's a lot of movement on some of the pitches he's throwing, so you're going to swing and miss sometimes. But you've got to keep taking your hacks and not be discouraged if you're swinging through some of those pitches or even strike out."
In addition to a title defense, the Cardinals embark on a generational shift. Matheny, 41, is the youngest manager in either league. Six years removed from his last season as a player, the Cardinals manager is 11 months younger than last season's lefthanded relief specialist, Arthur Rhodes.

In April of 1996, Hopkins returned to Missouri. He bounced around in the following years, spending time in Union and Joplin. Police reports say Hopkins gave police and his family members varying accounts of where Jessica was, including one story that she was living with a man named Capone somewhere in California. He said they were living in a hotel that police learned didn't exist.

The report said nonpublic schools serve more than 160,000 New Jersey students, but that enrollment dropped by more than 29,000 between 2004 and 2009, because of financial stress on families. Most of those students entered public schools, costing taxpayers more than $430 million a year, according to the report.
Elevation, proximity to the warm Atlantic Ocean, and intensity of the precipitation will be key players. The bulk of the storm just north and west of Route 95 will be wet snow, but even in cities from Washington, D.C. and Baltimore to Philadelphia, Trenton and New York City rain will become mixed with or change over completely to wet snow.
Glendale Mayor Elaine Scruggs said leaders have yet to come up with firm backup plans.

The merged carrier will surpass Delta Air Lines as the world's biggest by passenger traffic. It will combine United's Pacific operations with Continental's networks in Latin America and across the Atlantic.
Last week, however, the diocese burst the bubbles of those elated parishioners by announcing the Vatican actually had upheld 12 appeals, not 13 as widely reported, and St. Margaret Mary was the unlucky 13th parish. It was a crushing blow to those who had fervently fought to get the church reopened, and it should not have come to this.
Costumes by Paul Tazewell are first rate, especially Blanche's white, frilly gowns and frocks. He's cleverly made some great shirts for Stanley by riffing off the character's love of bowling. Many in the audience clearly wanted Underwood to wear as little as possible and he often obliges, but never exploitatively.
A A flood. A few hundred requests rolled in and continue to arrive for bumper stickers that readers recommended to remind drivers to use their turn signals. Your sticker and "Be a Thinker. Use your Blinker!" were the two most popular. I'll wait a week or so and then order the stickers. Hopefully you'll have them around Memorial Day.

Nowitzki might have received a nice ovation before tipoff, but it was Irving and the Cavs who were bathed in the applause of 17,443 fans at the end as they beat their first opponent with an above-.500 record.
"She heard a pop, then a scream," Villar said. The grandmother assumed the balloon had popped and scared the boy. She returned to the living room to find the boy lying by the couch with the gun next to him.
Dayanim said the deal also failed because the group couldn't resolve whether creditors and courts would view the buyout as valid without coming after Tapie for Full Tilt's other debts. More time to restore player balances would have helped resolve that, but the 90-day demand made that unworkable, he said.
Hagely provided Callaway some defensive help in left field to start the fifth when he ranged to his right and robbed March of a leadoff hit that could have gone for extra bases.
Making every effort to secure an interview with Orton after she appeared at SXSW in Austin, Texas, and was touring her way toward California, I managed to make only momentary telephone contact during her stopover in Salt Lake City. Before she begged off for tea and breakfast, Orton did acknowledge that she'd grown weary of the compulsive perfectionism engendered by studio-centric recording. (Attempts to follow up were thwarted first by the demands of sound check and then by noise outside and inside the Mexican restaurant Orton was ducking into for a bite before the gig.)
Newton was released from Cobb County Jail shortly after 7 p.m. after posting $5,000 bond, according to jail records.
In the 1980s, while non-Angelenos may have assumed that Milliken and Feniger were impressing customers with their exoticisms, the truth was that the chefs assumed most of the people in the dining room had tasted these things in their original form. Not all of their customers had been to Thailand, Lisbon or India, but a lot of them had; if not, Thai Town, Little Tokyo and Little India were not far away. (As Jonathan Roberts' review in the old California magazine read, if you weren't sure what chrysanthemum leaves were supposed to taste like in a salad, you were supposed to pretend that you did.) City was the first restaurant of its type that actually looked like Los Angeles.
“They’re gonna call me a liberal loose canon,” Meade said. “But I’m more fiscally conservative than any of the five conservatives on the committee.”
As the oil drifted closer to Florida, beachgoers in Pensacola waded into the gentle waves, cast fishing lines and sunbathed, even as a two-man crew took water samples. One of the men said they were hired by BP to collect samples to be analyzed for tar and other pollutants.

The work took place after Road Rant contacted the company Monday.
"It's a little hard to say," Veirs says. "If you took an African child in Mali who heard music of that area and brought them to the States in a different cultural context, would they forget the original music or go forward with that in their heart? My impression is that the first music goes in and informs and makes an impression. There's so much to be learned through music at a young age. I watch my child, at 2, learning rhythm and words. He can say, ‘Mexico,' because we sing ‘Jamaica Farewell' to him - ‘I've been from Maine to Mexico' - and he always jumps in to say, ‘Mexico!' "
He also said his expertise saved the county "several hundred thousand dollars" and that his skills "cannot simply be transferred to another individual by training."
“Now I don’t think about it. I just talk like I talk to people,” she said.
Grundy's attorney, William Swor, did not return messages late Thursday afternoon. He has said Grundy, who was indicted in March on two dozen criminal charges, "unequivocally denies the allegations in the indictment."
Whenever this issue comes up, all sides grab at the past and start waving the parts that flatter them. That's an endless sinkhole, one I try to avoid by asking, "What next?"
Ford acknowledged in his analysis of Green that he isn't a prototypical power forward -- Green is 6-feet-6.
When it comes to the different understandings of atonement embraced by our church, we can journey with each of them in prayer and worship without feeling ourselves torn asunder or compromised by their different emphases. It is possible to see in them all the same basic premise: that "earth and heaven are joined and man is reconciled to God" (as the Exsultet puts it!). Bickering over and then deciding finally exactly how that happens is less important than standing firm in our awed confession that in fact it has happened and is continuing to happen. The Anglican tradition rejoices in the great mysteries of our faith, not using "mystery" as an excuse for ignorance or indecision, but recognizing that all of our attempts to explain how God does what God does are going to be partial and incomplete.
They have been fooled before.
The goal is to attract new businesses from national and international markets to "The City of Arts," such as sit-down restaurants on Harbor Boulevard, and other development, retail and entertainment businesses, according to a city staff report.

In that game, the Patriots often kept tight ends in to block or sent in a tackle as an extra blocker. But this requires a balance between blocking up the rushers and sending enough guys out on routes for their spread offense to excel.
"That shows you that the guys in front of me played well enough that everything I had to do was pretty simple," Cronin said. "It's a credit to them that they made my job easier."
Dark Brazilian chestnut floors run throughout the first floor's main rooms. Also on this floor: a family/game room, a powder room and a one-of-a-kind "changing room" with a full bath and sauna.
And Santa tried to console her with renegotiated pre-nup.
How it works: A mugger with a pair of scissors cuts the purse right off your back and walks off with it in broad daylight. It can happen so quickly and easily in a crowded place — such as a subway or mobbed amusement park — that you might not even notice right away.
In recent weeks, Ofcom has directly contacted News Group Newspapers, News Corp.'s U.K. tabloid newspaper unit, to request documents related to civil phone-hacking cases.

He enjoyed caring for his two sons, ages 2 and 8. And Tsappidi, of Helmetta, remained persistent in his job search, combing the internet each day for openings. But he wasn’t having any luck.
He is No. 210 on the money list with $33,960. In his first five seasons on the PGA Tour, he averaged $107,585 per tournament. If he doesn't turn it around soon, Kim is in danger of losing his card.
Among the thousands of spectators along the square were World War II veterans bent with age, their suitcoats festooned with rows of medals.
Moreover, a vaccine against pleasure and relief, however derived, raises worrying ethical and legal issues that deserve more scrutiny than is currently being given in media coverage on the anti-addiction vaccine "breakthrough." Will vaccine therapy be implemented through legal coercion, as much of rehab is today? Will addicts take dangerously high levels of drugs in an attempt to surpass the vaccine's effect and achieve a high? (This has been observed in anti-cocaine vaccine trials, in both mice and humans.) Will children of drug users be vaccinated?
Phil Kirschner, New Jersey Business and Industry Association said Christie delivered a "powerful" address he said will boost the confidence of business owners, even though "the underlying economy is still weak." They are concerned whether unemployment taxes will rise in July, when the fund will be replenished, he said.
Logic would seem to dictate that a TV network could get better ratings by taking the path of least resistance. Find a time slot where the competition is light, or where existing programming would seem to attract a different group of viewers, and let your show shine there.
ø"I would never want to think about that," he said of the possibility that Welker could leave. "Wes is one of my great friends. I hope he's back. He certainly deserves it. He's done a great job since he's gotten here.
“Samsung’s surpassing of Nokia for cellphone market leadership represents not only a changing of the guard among handset brands but also a fundamental shift in the structure of the wireless market,” said Ian Fogg, senior principal analyst, mobile, for IHS. “Cellphone market growth is now being generated exclusively by the smartphone segment, and not by the feature phones, entry-level cellphones and ultra-low-cost handsets that had fueled the industry’s expansion over the previous decade.”
"We started off really bad," Creamer said. "You can't start off 17-0 and come back. It's very hard.

Vague Suspicions
As she recounted on a blog at poachedjobs.com, the restaurant-industry jobs website founded by Peter Bro, she got a job at Public before the restaurant had even opened. At the time, she was a "green rookie" who still called sheet pans "cookie sheets" and "had to be taught how to cut a spring roll on a bias." (Bro, who owns several Southeast Portland restaurants, including Broder, is consulting on Smallwares.)
Acting Education Commissioner Christopher Cerf said today was the "first I’ve heard of" the union’s recommendation. "It is very meaningful to me if the NJEA is thinking creatively about ways to improve the system," he said.
Budget cuts because of the declining tax revenue in the county and the state have forced Cherokee schools to squeeze more students into classes.
The St. Louis Chamber Chorus will perform a program of classics by the likes of Bach, Gesualdo and Purcell that have been finished or reconstructed by scholars and composers including Stravinsky and John Rutter. As usual, the venue has been chosen to match the music, and this one is a standout in a lot of ways: St. Alphonsus Liguori "Rock" Roman Catholic Church, itself beautifully reconstructed after a lightning strike to the church roof caused a five-alarm fire in 2007.
But Mandel did not spend the night, said the spokesman, Travis Considine, adding that Mandel traveled using campaign funds, not taxpayer money. Considine said he did not know how much money Mandel raised at the Bahamas event.
There also appears to be an obsession with other people's underwear. One article after another quotes indignant Americans huffing and puffing over the possible horror of seeing grandma's waist-highs flapping in the breeze.
Hanke, who has advised governments around the world on managing their currencies, argued that Greece appears bound to collapse under its debts as its economy shrinks. "Greece is doomed," he said.
Experts have yet to pinpoint why anxiety occurs in some people and not others. "There are a lot of questions but not a lot of definitive answers," says Dr. Brian Brennan, associate director for translational neuroscience at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass. People who undergo trauma or intense stress at an early age may be more prone. And there probably are a number of genes that contribute through their influence on levels of key brain chemicals, serotonin and norepinephrine, which are thought to be linked to depression and anxiety.
He attended a handful of U-M games -- "if you've got seats reserved for you, you might as well take them," he said -- further sealing his college decision.
Hartley said some local officials have voiced support for this idea, and the city is in the process of reviewing site control and other issues to consider using the lots as a bazaar of sorts.
A downstairs neighbor discovered Taylor's body, half naked in her bathtub, on June 4, 1994. Her fingernails were broken. There was semen on a blanket on her couch. Again, evidence was collected with no matches found.
Though lecture halls are shady and cool, attendees would be wise to bring plenty of sunscreen and hats for events at the outdoor venues and stages — hot, sunny weather is expected.
Adrianna: "I like to eat tortilla."
The redistricting would actually increase the number of delegates representing Carroll from four to eight, but opponents have noted that the four incumbents would all be placed in District 5 — essentially running against one another for three seats — and the other representatives would likely be Frederick or Howard county residents.

At 9:37 p.m., in the seventh, he crushes his third ball of the night, driving a fastball into right-center field for his third double, fans standing and applauding his sheer force. Yet he is eventually stranded on second. And for now, he is stranded on zero.
This year, the Knights were a group of blue-collar, unselfish kids, none of whom have signed with a Division I school. Though Cross fell to St. Raymond in the championship game, it still took home a CHSAA Brooklyn/Queens Diocesan title, which the Knights won just days after the death of Gilvary’s mother. From that point on, the players said they were competing for him.

While I have not been enamored with President Obama’s performance, the Republican presidential primaries have reaffirmed that he is a superior alternative to any of the Republican candidates. Gingrich, Santorum, Romney and Paul would, no doubt, see my position on expanding the safety net in the short run, to assist those who are unable to find work because of the economic downturn, and my call for reducing income inequality, as evidence that I favor turning America into a “European-style welfare state ... that would poison the very spirit of America,” as Mitt Romney has said about Obama’s efforts.
The 1,500-square-foot store features a variety of antiques, including an 1885 mahogany dresser, but what shoppers seem to remember most is Brucks' tell-it-like-it-is attitude and blunt personality.

“It’s like the total opposite from Brooklyn or Queens,” he said. “Certain areas are tough; out in Rhode Island, you don’t have to worry about anything. It’s mellow. Nobody is shooting, fighting. Everybody is out there to have a good time, do their work, graduate and go about their business.”
He said two advertisers did call the station with concerns, but both of them decided to stay with the program.
Turns out that was just a taste of the drama to come for the Blazers (20-23), who fell to 1-4 on a seven-game trip that has been a disaster. The Blazers managed just 12 points and five field goals in the first quarter and trailed 55-29 at halftime. At that point, it was fair to wonder if the Blazers would finish with more turnovers than field goals, because they had 17 turnovers and 11 made shots. By the time the game mercifully ended, five Knicks had reached double figures in scoring -- including Smith (23 points), Steve Novak (20), Amare Stoudemire (17) and Carmelo Anthony (16) -- and they had outshot the Blazers 53.8 percent to 37.3. Really, New York dominated the Blazers in every statistical category.
Quarcoopome has an ambitious special exhibition in mind that would return to the roots of the issue.
Q: Let's say the levy passes. The city already has a relatively modest investment in the arts through the general fund for RACC. Would you keep that investment the same, cut it or increase it?
Regarding "Texas leaders with balanced approach need to step up" (Page B1, Wednesday), columnist Patricia Kilday Hart hit the nail on the head when she wrote about business leaders not showing leadership in opposing actions by Gov.

They moved to Orange County in 1986 "to follow the American dream," Pernille says. "In 1986, Denmark was very regulated and this country was very entrepreneur friendly. There was quite a bit of difference. Here, if you say you're going to do something you can be sure it can be done."

Governments at all levels cut only 6,000 jobs in February and 1,000 in January, after a revision. That's a welcome change from the heavy layoffs by cash-strapped states and cities over the past two years. Last year alone they cut an average of 22,000 jobs per month.
Planned Parenthood Federation of America defended the Richmond clinic staff member for her professionalism in dealing with "a highly unusual person posing as a patient."

"Proponents of this legislation have repeatedly said that the new law provides a tool for local law enforcement, but I don't really believe that that's true or accurate," Harris said at an April 30 news conference. "We have the tools that we need to enforce laws in this state to reduce property crime and to reduce violent crime, to go after criminals that are responsible for human smuggling, to go after criminals that are responsible for those home invasions, kidnappings, robberies, murders."

Ordinary readers, however, may be more drawn to Kissinger's entertaining and sometimes gossipy accounts of his meetings with China's most august leaders. He describes, for example, Mao's "bantering and elliptical style of conversation … Mao advocated his ideas in a Socratic manner. He would begin with a question or an observation and invite comment. He would then follow with another observation. Out of this web of sarcastic remarks, observations and queries would emerge a direction, though rarely a binding commitment."
O’Reilly was charged with criminal mischief and a further search revealed he had a $500 warrant out for his arrest for failure to appear out of Bloomfield, N.J., police said.
Still, world leaders have embraced the serious-minded Monti as a welcome relief from his predecessor, Silvio Berlusconi, whose sex scandals and clownish personality had turned him and Italy into something of a laughingstock. The markets have rewarded Monti's agenda of austerity cuts and structural reforms by lowering Rome's borrowing costs, which hit intolerable levels in the autumn and precipitated Berlusconi's downfall.

About the Timberwolves: Only two NBA teams — the Sacramento Kings and the Los Angeles Clippers — have fewer wins than Minnesota, which has lost three in a row and 11 of 13. The latest defeat came Wednesday night, 128-122, at the Phoenix Suns. ... Love, a Lake Oswego High School alum, is averaging 24.3 points and 17.0 rebounds in his last eight games. He leads the NBA in rebounding and is trying to become the first player since Moses Malone in 1982-83 to average 20 or more points and 15 or more rebounds in a season. ... Former Blazers forward Martell Webster made his season debut Tuesday at Golden State after missing the first 24 games because of microdiscectomy surgery. ... The Timberwolves have led six of their last games by double-figures but are 2-6 during that stretch. They've lost six games this season when leading by 10 or more points. ... Minnesota, 1-14 on the road this season, is playing its fourth game in a season-long six-game trip.
When you feel like you have gotten the short end of the stick, or a raw deal, trying to negotiate with a credit-card issuer is a bit like dealing with the Internal Revenue Service, only without the IRS' charm. Arguing with a card issuer over the way they have treated you -- or mistreated you, more likely -- is like fighting City Hall or working with a nasty boss: resistance feels futile.
Livingston said he's not sure how long he'll have Johnson, which is just another fact of life in the D-League -- juggling the changing rosters. While Johnson is here, though, Livingston has the chance to work on developing a very versatile talent.

Gov. John Kitzhaber has already helped by reinvigorating TriMet's leadership, but now the governor must keep the pressure on. And even though it likely can't happen in this session, Kitzhaber also needs to pursue legislation to make transit operators no longer subject to binding-interest arbitration, a process that tends to polarize and paralyze -- just when speed and moderation are imperative.
Oen, 26, was recovering from a shoulder injury that prevented from training full speed in Flagstaff.
• Rob Moseley, Eugene Register Guard: Thomas has doubters, just not on UO sideline: Entering Friday’s Pac-12 title game against UCLA in Autzen Stadium, Thomas ranks 12th nationally in pass efficiency with a quarterback rating of 158.6, behind only Luck and Barkley in the conference. Thomas’ ratio of 27 touchdowns to five interceptions — two of which went through receivers’ hands when the Ducks faced WSU — far exceeds those of Foles and Price. “I’m not really worried about who’s rating me or anything like that,” Thomas said. “I’m just worried about getting wins.”
In fact, if youre going to try to rationalize a stupid action by an athlete over the last week, youd have a much easier time doing it with Amare Stoudemire. Following the Knicks' 104-94 Game 2 loss to the Heat, Stoudemire punched the door that held a fire extinguisher and cut his hand. Reports still vary on how serious the cuts are, but he clearly wont play Thursday in Game 3 in New York and hes probably done for the series, which means hes probably done for the season. Stoudemire was immediately branded stupid, selfish and guilty of an unforgivable act.
øI would say it is not fair and it is fair. Our sport is such a wide range of athletes. If you constantly pick who you think is going to be the best people to compete, nobody's ever really going to get the chance … Just like me in 2004, if they would've chose who was the best, I don't think they would've chose me that year. But I made the team, so it's a love-and-hate thing.
A bill authorizing two new casinos in Atlantic City was approved by an Assembly panel. It could be voted on by the entire Assembly in about two weeks.
One good source of money may be selling individual stocks. Many investors hang onto stocks because they don't want to pay the 15 percent capital gains tax. But Slott says the likelihood of a coming boost to that rate makes it doubly sensible as a way to pay for the conversion. "You'll never see a rate as low as 15 percent again in your lifetime, I don't think," he says. The top capital gains tax rate is currently set to revert back to 20 percent next year.
Remedies to address the structural deficit include:
Age is a factor no doubt, but in some way overdoing the age angle takes away from what Couples can do on the course. On a given day, Couples is one of the best golfers in the world. Friday was such a day for the University of Houston alum.
The Irish called whiskey "uisce beatha," which translates to "water of life," and by the 19th century U.S. distillers had cooked up a whiskey niche of their own, with corn-based concoctions making Kentucky's soul as much about bourbon as horses. The combination of grains and distillation methods has evolved over time and fashion, and even the spelling - "whiskey" or "whisky" - might provoke a barstool battle. Now, thanks to craft distillers, the water of life can come in many flavors, proofs, bottles and barrels - and even frozen. Here's a round of sites for experiencing the spirit's true spirit.

Well I'm not running for president to conform to Washington's conventional thinking - I'm running to challenge it. I'm not running to join the kind of Washington groupthink that led us to war in Iraq - I'm running to change our politics and our policy so we can leave the world a better place than our generation has found it.
For charcoal grill: Soak about 2 cups of wood chips in water for at least 25 minutes. Prepare a grill with charcoal briquets. Let coals burn down until covered with ash. Arrange most of the coals on one side of the grill and the remaining coals on the other side so that half the grill will be hot and the other half will be medium-low heat. Drain wood chips and spread half atop the hot side of the coals after cleaning the grill (instructions below). Alternately, add a couple of wood chunks to the coals.

Prop. A takes aim at this system by mandating competitive bidding, standard practice for most government work and, in the case of garbage collection, used by the overwhelming majority of other cities in the state. Putting the contract out to bid ensures the best bargain for San Francisco and could bring other benefits such as franchise fees in the millions, backers argue.

The roadside picnics mostly consisted of bologna sandwiches and milk. Ray Ryburn bought the bologna and bread at small groceries along the Mother Road. "I know that he bought the bologna in a hunk because it was cheaper than sliced so Mom had to cut it to make sandwiches," Ryburn recalled. "We argued about who got the biggest hunk."

Help may be needed here in Cuyahoga County, however, since the new law bars boards of election from mailing an absentee ballot request to every registered voter. This practice in recent years in Cuyahoga County has encouraged close to half the electorate to vote by mail and dramatically reduced congestion -- and tension -- at the polls.
Paul Clement: Well, Justice Kagan, we don't think it's a matter of timing alone, and we think it has very substantive effects. Because if Congress tried to regulate at the point of sale, the one group that it wouldn't capture at all are the people who don't want to purchase health insurance and also have no plans of using health care services in the near term. And Congress very much wanted to capture those people. I mean, those people are essentially the golden geese that pay for the entire lowering of the premium.
"Jimmy is my hero," Croft said. "Growing up in Rio Linda, I'd go watch guys such as Jimmy and the Kaeding brothers (Tim and Brent) race at Marysville. I'd learn a lot just watching them, and I could anticipate them making a move on the track before they did."

"Our defense played great," Teeters said. "I can't remember how long they had the ball at the end of the game, but it felt like forever and my defense did a great job keeping them out. They got an 8-meter in there, and I just saw the ball and went for it and cleared it out."

Q: Hey, Brian: If Dan Gilbert knew LeBron James was going to leave, would Mike Brown have been fired? Would it have led to Danny Ferry quitting? Obviously Gilbert was upset that LeBron left, but if he fired a decent head coach and lost a bright general manager as a result, then I can understand why that may have sent him over the edge. --Scott Heritage, Phoenix

Late in the afternoon, I took Grace to my older brother's house so my wife, Therese, could have some time to herself. My nieces Alexandra and Samantha set up Wii Fit and had me run a four-minute course a couple of times. We also played some other games. I love Wii Fit. Alexandra and Samantha kept telling me what a good job I was doing and that I was smaller than when they previously saw me. I appreciated the kind words more than they knew.

In 2008, two local service-contract sellers settled suits by then-Attorney General Jay Nixon by paying fines and agreeing to follow consumer-friendly tactics. It seemed a victory for consumers, at least until 2009, when Nixon's successor - Chris Koster - lobbed new consumer-fraud allegations in suits against the same firms.

Darker, too. DiNizio’s lyrics were real-world, grown-up stuff; sometimes frighteningly so. Fascinated by the psychological realism of old thriller movies, he wrote about maddening jealousy (“Green Thoughts”), romantic obsession (“Behind the Wall of Sleep”), divorce (“House We Used to Live In”) and passion slipping into violence (“Blood and Roses”) with force and clarity.

"It is such an iconic building, we'd hate to see the interior gutted and replaced," she said. "We understand it would fall under private ownership, and we'd like the opportunity to work with whoever buys it, if they remodel, on ways to preserve the building."
We believe the state needs to develop a strategy for adequately funding mental health services for people incarcerated in jail, whether directly to the sheriffs' departments, directly to the Community Mental Health organizations, or through resolving the insurance benefit issues. Given that prisoners with other diseases are not denied treatment, we join in questioning why those with mental illness don't receive the treatment they need, especially since withholding treatment exacerbates the very behavior for which they may have been incarcerated.
-Make the spiral about 3 feet high and 6 feet wide. If you make it bigger, you won't be able to reach all the plants easily, and some of the plants might get too much shade. If you make it smaller, you'll compromise the ability of the stone or brick walls to warm the soil effectively.
Wendell Maxey: You can always count on Armon for two things: to be real with you and be ready to shoot when he gets in the game. Can't blame the guy for having a quick trigger with the mop up minutes he played for Nate McMillan to close out the season. Going forward, I think you bring Armon back. He's a good size guard with an aggressive drive for the game. The smooth lefty showed some growth signs during his stint with the Idaho Stampede and is still learning how to run a team and play the right way (read: cut down on the turnovers youngster). Besides, you have to bring Johnson back. Who else is going to come running and cheering off the bench with Patty Mills?

A sentencing hearing for Turner is scheduled for May.
If a left tackle who is an excellent value is available at 19, I'd have no problem if the Bears selected him. I don't suspect that will be the case, however. There probably are three offensive tackles worth taking that high -- Matt Kalil of Southern Cal, Riley Reiff of Iowa and Jonathan Martin of Stanford. My hunch is all three will be off the board by the time the Bears pick, and better values will be available at other positions. The Bears' swing tackle in 2012 very well could be Chris Williams, or, if Williams wins a starting offensive tackle job, the swing tackle could be Webb. Either way, at this point it looks like Williams is moving back to tackle.
"Our perception is very different from the study," said Ray, who says quality of life in Hough is better than many outsiders think.

Among Harvey's qualifications are that he's been married three times and possibly gained some insights from his two ex-wives about how they failed to keep him. This is not a history to inspire confidence, but in the new movie "Think Like a Man," we're expected to believe that every woman in the film bought the book and started living her life according to it. The twist comes when the men in their lives discover their secret reading and study the book themselves. Now the men know the women's game plan.

Another advantage, Warren says, is that the plays' story lines often dispel myths about disease. That was the case with "Eat," which made clear that eating disorders are biological illnesses, that they're not caused by parents and that they can be treated.
Learning new words adds gray matter, as a matter of fact. (Your brain doesn't have to shrink with age.) And adults actually are better at learning new languages than kids, if you can put aside linguistic habits (the brain gets trained to ignore sounds that it doesn't need for comprehension) and embrace the nonsensical. That's how kids learn; they associate sounds with objects, then recognize sounds and words as labels, then link words with meaning. So to learn a new language, whether it's with a class or through audio tapes, remember these tips:

Workers pay larger co-pays for office visits, and they must kick in - often hundreds or thousands of dollars - for surgeries and medical tests.
Is raising awareness important today? Yes – it is of life-saving importance! There may be minimum-wage workers, women who care for children or a sick family member or who transform houses into clean and beautiful homes. They are often uninsured or underinsured, lack accurate health information and face barriers to health care and health education. We want to reach this group, as well as senior citizens, because they deserve to have a mammogram and early detection information about breast cancer. Men, too, can be diagnosed with breast cancer.
Wadhams pointed to a Wall Street Journal column that drew a parallel to 1980. At the end of February that year, Ronald Reagan was trailing Jimmy Carter by 18 points and there was talk of a "draft Ford" movement within the Republican Party, Wadhams said.
Financially, this system is paying for itself, just slowly. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power charges me less than half a penny per gallon, so technically, gray water has saved me only $95 in water costs so far. But it's also reduced my sewer charge by about one-third, saving me an extra $3.30 per month. In drought-prone Southern California, gray water feels like the right thing to do. It's been the easiest, most sensible, hassle-free, sustainable system I've put in place at my house.

Over the last century, or longer, crushing poverty has institutionalized another form of slavery that is commonplace, expected -- lawful.

That's not the way it usually works.

Failure is an option, but only when you've done something that says, "This is the most honest thing we can put out there." So that allows us to make it as weird as we want because we believe in what we're doing.

As I write about in my book "Race and Liberty," these old-style liberals – like their counterparts today (think Ward Connerly) – believed in individual freedom, Christianity, the Constitution, colorblindness and capitalism.

If this isn't a perfect example of why the U-T is bleeding readership, I don't know what is. Apparently the Republican Party in San Diego (who also is bleeding voter identification) and their endorsed mayoral candidate now have the U-T doing its bidding.

A During my student years I had opportunities to study and work with a lot of great people. Gary Burton was one, and was a remarkable teacher for the incredible variety of approaches and ways of thinking about improvisation that he brought to the table. He had an exceptionally open ear and mind, and found ideas and inspiration in all kinds of music. Another major influence was my composition teacher at UC Berkeley, Andrew Imbrie, one of the master composers of his generation.

The courts have been a factor. The Supreme Court ruled in January 2010 that corporations and unions could spend money directly on campaigns. That sparked the rise of "super PACs" — which are allowed to raise unlimited sums — and the GOP promptly launched an aggressive campaign for the midterm election. The ruling was a game-changer that will result in hundreds of millions of dollars being spent on behalf of political campaigns next year.

It all added up to the Blazers' best performance of the series, but it nearly wasn't enough as Dallas got a huge game from reserve Jason Terry (29 points, seven assists), and another steady performance from star Dirk Nowitzki (25 points, nine rebounds). But this time, the heroes from Game 1 and 2 came back to Earth. Jason Kidd had more turnovers than three-pointers, and Peja Stojakovic was a quiet 3 for 7.

Most people would call them copycat suicides.

Cancerous cells produce a boatload of EphA2, way more than normal cells do. While that would seem to restrict the cancer cells' movement, paradoxically, the opposite is true. EphA2 morphs into a bad cop that helps cancerous cells spread and form additional tumors. This two-faced conduct has been a major mystery to cancer researchers, who have wondered how the molecule can function as both a tumor promoter and suppressor.

As with the calamari, the gnocchi ($8) is plated in a pool, here of lemony butter that drips off every forkful. Soft and delicately flavored with milky ricotta and astringent chard, the gnocchi are topped with fork-tender squash and bright squash blossoms. The tastiest entree is the hearty Sweet Briar Farms Pork Blade Chop ($19). While the pork is tender and sweet, the accompanying gratinéed tomatoes add more crunch than flavor. But the star of the dish is the zucchini-potato cakes which, because they absorb the juices from the pork and the tomatoes, contain all the multi-layered abundance of gorgeous flavor so sorely lacking in many of the other Daily Cafe foods.

"I'm concerned about them," said Wedge, when asked if he knew how much work they'd been getting. "Choo has played one game in right."
We have great relations with all accounts, actually including Amazon, but we don't write off smaller accounts just because they might be independent. Norton is the biggest independent publishing house, and it's part of our heritage and part of our fabric. So we really identify with bookstores out there who are struggling to make it. And we offer our authors to them and to existing bookstores. It's much harder to offer an author online. People want to meet an author. That being said, I love promoting books online.
In Peru, which has a sizeable population of Chinese immigrants, there is even an Asian-Peruvian fusion dish known as chifa, a mash-up of the term "chow fan," which refers to Chinese fried rice.

Jessica, then one of seven remaining "Idol" finalists (and, by many accounts, one of the most talented), received the fewest votes from viewers.

But Reimold hit into a fielder's choice grounder to end the inning, and Below gave up just one run for all that wildness.

“We will review this plan, but will do so knowing that solving the problems facing our poorest children in failing in urban schools is more complicated than throwing around slogans and blaming teacher job protections," she said in a prepared statement, adding that poor children and their families face social and economic problems that have a direct negative impact on the ability to learn.

"But I'm still very positive about what we can do and what I can do. I'm not going to let anyone else tell me otherwise. That's one of the things I had to tell myself.

In my job as The Arizona Republic wine guy, I get to taste a lot of value wines. In my other job as a wine geek, I often taste amazing, expensive, rare wines. This year, after holding in esteem the giants of old, coveting them, praising them and then tasting them, it struck me that a shift had occurred. Many of the great (and horrendously expensive) names are paper tigers.

The problem was, the whole thing was fake, according to the FTC.

Long an admirer of Demme's work, particularly with such actresses as Jodie Foster, Melanie Griffith and Mary Steenburgen, DeWitt was excited to join the ranks of Demme goddesses. Despite runs on the Fox series "Standoff" and the AMC hit " Mad Men," however, the theater veteran feels she's still learning her on-screen craft. The director's choice of shooting as intimately as a home movie -- often with practical video cameras in the hands of cast members -- first confused her, then deepened her performance.
Chuck D, who along with LL Cool J presented the Beastie Boys, and toured with the Beasties as part of Public Enemy, noted that Adam Horovitz, Adam Yauch and Michael Diamond were the embodiment of what music could be. The music isn't about color; it's about feeling.
I agree that our schools are in a great deal of hurt. But I don't think we can fix the problems by raising property taxes on the backs of the large portion of "not so wealthy" people in Oregon. You (Mr. Hellman) have a great retirement through PERS which is paid for by us not so fortunate. The majority of those of us that are retired are trying to get by on Social Security. If the politicians and the public employees had to do as we do, they would not be so willing to raise taxes.

In Rome, Naples and parts of Southern Italy such as Abruzzo, Calabria and Puglia, it has been customary to celebrate Christmas Eve with a festive seafood meal called the cenone (big supper), consumed before the midnight mass.

That may not surprise you. The Lake Mary Republican, after all, has had more financial pitfalls and personal bumbling than the Everglades has gators — everything from missed mortgage payments and unpaid tolls to multimillion-dollar judgments and a suspended drivers license. (A 2010 disclosure that showed Dorworth had monthly mortgage payments of $9,700 — and a monthly income of only $2,700 — told most people all they needed to know.)
The first time Lindbergh and Fox met back in March, it turned out to be a slugfest with Lindbergh winning 15-13. Tuesday's first round district tournament game between the two teams was again a slugfest, but third-seeded Lindbergh did most of the slugging.

If we as a nation lost our innocence on September 11, is it possible we also gained something of value? Sometimes I think our gains have been only in the areas of hypervigilance, paranoia, defensiveness, and the like, which would not be real gains at all. At other times I see the possibility that we have also gained something in self-awareness, compassion, and a sense of connectedness. At least I hope so. We still have more work to do, though, along with our brothers and sisters around the world. Maybe by marking the tenth anniversary of 9/11 we will find ourselves renewing our commitment to these important goals.

African-Americans, workers, consumers and environmentalists don't fare much better in Bork's America. For instance, he supports the constitutionality of literacy tests and poll taxes in state elections — those notorious instruments the South used to keep blacks from voting. Imagine how easily Bork's acolytes would green-light the passel of laws passed in Republican-controlled states to tamp down minority voting. Florida's law imposing high bureaucratic hurdles and punishing fines on groups collecting voter registrations wouldn't cause a flicker of concern.

“Wrecking Ball,” unlike the rest of the DVD set, is not just straight performance, but an artful mix of performance, vintage photos, black-and-white footage of Springsteen soundchecking in the empty stadium, and some of the fireworks — not the musical kind, but actual fireworks — that Springsteen added to help say farewell to the venue in style.

Answer: You know, obviously we're missing his bat. He started off producing a lot of runs for us and helping us out, but in the grand scheme of things, it's a team and all we can do is have guys step in there and try to fill that void.

The implications for returning to what economists call "full employment" are significant. According to calculations by Michael Greenstone of the Hamilton Project, if the labor force grows by 90,000 a month, then an economy creating 200,000 jobs a month would take about eight years to return to full employment. If the labor force grows by 125,000 a month -- plausible if discouraged workers begin returning to the labor force -- it will take almost 14 years to return to full employment.

In the Christian tradition, for example, the Emerging Church invites participation from all who find themselves attracted to the teachings, actions and person of Jesus. It isn't crucial that members call themselves Christians, or that they believe Bible stories literally (rather than metaphorically), or even that they are believers rather than agnostics and atheists. As long as people want to sincerely engage with the teachings of Jesus and with the communities that seek to live by those values — "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you," "Love your neighbor," "Blessed are the peacemakers" — they are welcome.

Whether you're doing this with a country or with your spouse, it's a bad idea.

What is the 79-year-old Widman's artistic legacy? Hull describes Widman as a visionary. That's overstatement. Rather, Widman had a vision.

Still, the Justice Department fielded a strong team. One of its prosecutors is Daniel Butler, successful prosecutor of the D.C. Madam, who later killed herself. Court officials selected the large, ceremonial courtroom for the arraignment, and a court spokesman appeared before the proceedings to brief reporters on the statues of great law-givers adorning the wall behind the judge: Hammurabi, Moses, Solon and Justinian - the last holding a globe and a long scroll (or was it a baseball and bat?). The clerk read out the case, "United States of America vs. William Clemens, aka Roger Clemens" - as if the defendant was hiding behind a nefarious alias.

While Beijing in theory possesses enormous control over the levers of its economy, it has serious difficulty manipulating those levers to its desired effect.

It would be greasy-haired and heavily accented, and it could go on forever, or until one of them said, "I'm finished."

The influence of painting on photography, in fact, is one theme of the show. In 1892, for example, Denis painted "On the Beach (Two Girls Against the Light)." He returned 17 years later to take a photo against the light of two other girls wading in water by the beach. Although they are swinging a younger child this time, the swerve of their bodies and their carefree manner make them look as if they came straight out of the painting.

Gregg Doyel, CBSSports.com: "What I'm seeing is a lot of debate about whether Trent Richardson is worth going as early as he's going to go. It's everywhere, and it's a fascinating concept: In today's NFL, have running backs been so devalued by the passing explosion -- and their careers so compromised by the league's violence -- that they're no longer a value pick early in the first round? It's a great question, but I have an even better answer: He's worth it when he's as good as Trent Richardson . . . we haven't seen a guy like this since Adrian Peterson. Before him? Marshall Faulk. Then Barry Sanders. That's how far back you have to go to find three more promising running backs, pre-draft, than Trent Richardson."

Supervisors seemed to agree that on funding options, seeking a sales tax from voters is preferable to a parcel tax. Certainly, it's cheaper for residents, since visitors would contribute to the revenue. To generate $10 million a year from a parcel tax would require a flat $21 tax on the county's 471,000 parcels. In contrast, a 1/16th cent sales tax for parks would generate $12 million a year, costing $8.89 each year for an average household.

This is the actual story straight from John 'Zap' Zapotocky, 91 years young, who has been SUP surfing since the 1940's. He learned how from the Duke. Even if you were not at Doheny and did not take part in this year's festivities, maybe you heard about it from someone. Don't discount the story that it appeared as though everyone was having a good time. Surfing, according to Duke Kahanamoku, the greatest surfer who ever lived, is first and foremost about having fun. And the best surfer is the one having the MOST fun.

Shaw combines a traditionalist's approach and a chef's creative flair when making his aguas. He's outfitted his classic jars with spigots; he spikes his cucumber-lime agua with Serrano chile and a little salt. On a recent night behind the stoves of his new kitchen, Shaw shared a favorite trick. Make two batches of your favorite agua, he suggests, and freeze one batch in ice cube trays to use when serving. The agua fresca cubes won't dilute the drink.

Happy birhtday: It's Christine's sweet 16. More than 300 people are expected to attend, including Danielle's ex, Tom, and his new wife. The guests start to arrive and walk the red carpet. Danielle says it's a benefit (though we never hear where the money Christine "earns" is going to), and Danielle got everything donated. Kim G. is there, and Tom Staub shows up with his new wife. There's a nice little reunion. Christine makes her entrance, bizarrely enough, on the shoulders of a professional bodybuilder. Jillian makes her singing debut. No comment. A good time is had by all.

There was nothing wildly luxurious in their spending, no polo ponies or pearls, just the obligatory private schools, Bloody Mary brunches at the Inn, station wagons with yachting flags, silver wedding presents, lots of dogs, the whiskey. They borrowed from banks and relatives to keep the city shining. They borrowed against their houses. They sold Aunt Cornelia's breakfront. They ignored bills and they despaired.

I spent part of the morning aboard the MS Dixie II, a paddle wheeler that leaves from Zephyr Cove's dock, traverses the southern part of the lake and takes a spin around Emerald Bay. Halfway through the two-hour excursion, it occurred to me that in the 46 years I've been coming to Lake Tahoe, I've never once been out in the middle of the lake. I can report that out there, the water is an even more impossibly blue hue than you see from shore.

If you're bored at home and need a hobby, take up exercise. I haven't owned a working bicycle since I was about 10 years old. But who needs one? Jogging is a form of exercise that can be an entertaining way to get out of the house without emptying your wallet. It's free, and though daunting at first, it can actually be fun if you give it a chance. It is a great, relaxing way to explore your neighborhood. Run around your local park or find biking trails to jog through. Finding nice running paths is part of the fun, and it's the perfect way to keep you interested in your surroundings, and less focused on the strain of running. Running can also be a group activity, so get your friends involved and run with them.

The virus-filled droplets that spread flus don't hang in the air long and certainly don't spend much time floating near the ceiling, Kahn says, so even with a fan at full blast, the bulbs probably wouldn't zap enough germs to reduce the risk of flu, let alone "sanitize" a house.

"Of course it would end like this, with a personal decision that has become public property, offered for the world to consume on live TV. Everything has been building toward this LeBron James announcement on ESPN on Thursday night. Not since Game 5, not since his last visit to Madison Square Garden, not even since he and Dwyane Wade signed the contracts with a 2010 opt-out that turned this summer into Armageddon.

Because while we, as a society, still pay lip service to appreciating honesty, loyalty, marital fidelity, not getting involved in protracted land wars in Asia, etc., the reality is that today if there's money to be made, you can almost always find some ethical wiggle room. Just ask the record producer creating a "mashup" from two existing songs, the movie studio subjecting an entirely new generation to the idiocy of Moe, Larry and Curly or the author "updating" Jane Austen's classic novel, "Pride and Prejudice," by turning the Bennet sisters into an invading species of interstellar vampire supermodels.

Which brings us to hypersonic. Programs involving first-time technologies have historically been extremely expensive to develop and engineer, and almost as costly to test. Like ballistic missiles in the 1950s and the Strategic Defense Initiative in the ’90s, expect serial failures on the launching pad until the technology is understood, let alone perfected. DARPA’s two earlier test hypersonic vehicles both crashed and burned — though not before the last reached Mach 20, an incredible 20 times the speed of sound.

“For the past two years we’ve been doing local and regional triathlons,” said Colleen Fossett, the club’s president. “Most people start out thinking they aren’t going to be able to do it but they get so hooked.”
"I say this joking around. This guy Joe Lundardi has no agenda. How would you like to wake up in the morning and all you do is bracketology all day long? Can you imagine that? He doesn't pay attention to his wife, he doesn't pay attention to his children, all he does all night long is bracketology. So just follow him because his batting average is incredible. The only thing obviously is he doesn't know where teams go, so if he does they're in, they're in. Everybody call Joe. Here's his number, by the way, just write this down. But just ask him because he's really on the money most of the time. I think Seton Hall is worthy to get in but you're all going to say well, he loves Kevin Willard like a son. I think Seton Hall is terrific and they've had a good year.

And for all the awful statistics, the full extent of Indiana's problem may not be known.
Matt Colgan, who was a Chronicle Rising Star Chef in 2002, has pretty much stayed the course, with the help of sous chef Michael Cook. However, when I visited the restaurant more than a year ago, it was a little off, so I removed it from the Top 100. Now it appears someone else will be bumped, because this Oakland restaurant is again at the top.

"The first year, we were like, 'Wow, this is easy,' " Tracy Klasna said. "But last year kicked our butts."
I've often thought of Paris as a museum. The French city is a work of art, from some other time. I see Memphis the same way -- just an hour behind Eastern time but decades removed from 21st-century life.
As a result, Tampa plans to ban many weapons (clubs, slingshots, brass knuckles) and items that could be used as weapons (crowbars, glass bottles, water pistols) outside the Aug. 27-30 convention — but it cannot ban guns carried with a state concealed weapons permit.

Sure, but none of that detracts from the essence of "Titanic," which is to plunge viewers into a bygone world, the better for them to witness its destruction first-hand. And when that end comes, the audience doesn't just see it but feel it, whether in the sight of an elderly couple embracing as frigid water eddies around their bed or that valiant orchestra playing "Nearer My God to Thee," or in the horror reflected in the eyes of Kathy Bates' unsinkable Molly Brown as she beholds the slow, fatal descent from one of the "Titanic's" too-few lifeboats.
I was feeling a little blue this past week. Life's worries. The usual stuff. I had a family dinner commitment, it was out in Ann Arbor, and though I was tired and didn't feel like making the trip, the plans already were made.

Fr. Dan Barron is director of Spiritual Formation at St. John the Great Catholic University in San Diego. He commented: "...the essence of the sacred is otherness.

If so, choose Option 3: Special language should be used in sacred texts.

Mr. Icahn is well known for rocking corporate boardrooms. One tool he has used is to buy up cheap stock and debt of companies he believes may be headed to bankruptcy court, such as Trans World Airlines, Marvel Entertainment Group and, more recently, Trump Entertainment Resorts. When they do file, he uses his investments to take control of the business. It isn't clear whether Mr. Icahn is following a similar strategy with LightSquared, and Mr. Icahn declined to comment.

In "Incident on 57th Street," Johnny is torn between life on the street and time with his girl, Jane. He goes from trying to meet girls on Easy Street to the hustlers on Shanty Lane. The street offers everything, from gentle innocence to hard realism. It's where kids play, where Johnny will meet his girl, and where trouble awaits. Johnny and Jane are good for each other. In the end, Johnny has to choose the life he wants. (At one of Springsteen's last concerts in Cleveland, he dedicated this song to longtime rock writer Jane Scott.)
Funeral services for Mootnick, who is survived by a sister, Ronnie Weinberger, will be held at 10 a.m. Tuesday at Groman Eden Mortuary in Mission Hills.
Just what merits protest, anyway, isn’t as clear as it once was. K8 Hardy, the fashion artist, has devoted a wall of (often witty) photos and prints to the fact that women’s shoes hurt. The Occupy Wall St. Arts & Labor group has protested the Biennial itself this time, denouncing the Whitney for taking sponsorship money from DeutscheBank and the auction house Sotheby’s. (Sotheby’s, the OWS group noted, locked out its unionized workers last year.) They said the Biennial “perpetuates a myth that art functions like other professional careers and that participation in the exhibition, for which artists themselves are not compensated, will secure a sustainable vocation. This fallacy encourages young artists to incur debt from which they will never be free … .”
The truth is, football is brutality. It's stylized violence, and it always has been, whether it was Night Train Lane doing the hitting or James Harrison. And if you take that away, it stops being football, and it becomes something else. On many levels, that's OK. It's good for the game to continue to evolve, and maybe the things you love the most about football are exactly what Goodell, the NFL owners, and the major television networks love promoting about the game: star quarterbacks and lots of scoring.
The city requires officers to have four-year college degrees in criminal justice or law enforcement. Maddox said because of that, the department is able to offer quality public safety services to its residents.
The reason given was that all American could do was issue a credit for a future flight. But since my wife wouldn't be able to use the credit, they weren't even going to do that.

Something was amiss. McMillan could feel it from the start.
But Bess Kargman’s 90-minute “First Position” not only shows hundreds of dancers battling for recognition, it focuses on the professional ambitions and personal lives of seven participants, giving the film what we can call "Glee" appeal. What’s more, her chosen subjects all manage to live their dreams despite setbacks, disappointments and injuries---even if some of the happy endings come to light only in an update during the closing credits.
Wednesday, Dec. 7: "Neil Berg's 102 Years of Broadway." From "Oklahoma" to "Wicked," the great songs of Broadway musicals come to life with a cast of Broadway performers.

Road woes. In their first 19 seasons, the Rockies have had exactly one season when they posted a winning road record. That was 2009, when they went 41-40. Losing the opening series in Houston to the Astros was a bad omen.
Asked why many Holocaust survivors still talk about shame, he says, "There is always shame because you think the abuse says something about you. You are the victim that inspired the evil in man to be activated."
He said this week that reducing the cost-of-living adjustment for retirees or current employees might not be legal, meaning it might apply only to newly hired workers. In fact, the solid concept of reducing other benefits for current workers appears to be in trouble, too.
Barry Jones is a British scientist who steals an atomic bomb from the laboratory where he works. Appalled by the weapon's power, he threatens to set it off and destroy London unless his government agrees to ban nuclear research. The scale of the subject and the scale of the film were at odds; this was a small production, in black-and-white, directed by the Boulting brothers, John and Roy. Yet it won an Oscar for best screenplay, and major nominations from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and the Venice Film Festival. The resourceful cinematographer was Gilbert Taylor.
Doug Bray, Multnomah County Circuit Court's trial court administrator, said judges have wide discretion to order records sealed. There are no specifics dictating when a record should be sealed or what a lawyer has to do to get one sealed, Bray said.

"You just have to prepare yourself for a battle. It's pretty intense on the ice during a playoff series at any given time. You don't sit before a game thinking you're going to get hurt, but you know you're going to get banged up. That's just the way the sport is. It's hockey."

My rant this week is about 2011’s most rant-able game, “Mass Effect 3.” Despite the shortcomings pointed out by many, I really enjoyed the game. I played the campaign exhaustively, collecting basically every War Asset and getting the best possible ending without having an “ME2” imported game.
‘But I’m only a critic!’’ exclaims a victim who’s about to be sliced up by a pendulum operated ax in “The Raven,’’ a thriller that posits—more entertainingly than convincingly — that Edgar Allan Poe spent the last five days of his life tracking down a serial killer inspired by his tales of terror.
The same photo accompanies a report by Jacksonville Fox affiliate WAWS, detailing a protest staged by University of Florida students last month, which Jones and his church attended.
It's difficult to believe that the NFL draft (which began in 1936) was almost a throwaway TV show when it premiered in April 1980. Chet Simmons, the ESPN president at the time, asked NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle if his 6-month old network could televise the draft. Rozelle's legendary reply: "Why would you want to do that?"
Mutter was honored for her actions to preserve the history of women in the Marines.
Make sure your policy includes an "alternate care benefit," which generally features language recognizing that new trends in long-term care are emerging, and coverage could be provided in the future for those not specifically spelled out now.

We reached out to Romney’s campaign, but officials had no response.
Gov. Nathan Deal on Thursday signed House Bill 685, which provides definitions and hearing procedures for determining whether a dog is dangerous or vicious. It defines procedures for handling and keeping them, including muzzling and requiring a secure enclosure. If a dog has been defined as vicious, the owner must carry $50,000 in insurance and the dog must be microchipped.
"You need to have a pretty mellow dog who would go along with it," said Saltvold. "A hyper dog would probably freak out."
At spas opening up in Florida and throughout the country, clients sit in special rooms infused with high concentrations of salt. They say it opens up their sinuses, drains mucus, reduces swelling of the bronchial tubes and boosts their immune systems.
“I always looked at rapping like I looked at skateboarding,” says Brown, who admits that his initial distaste for his natural voice compelled him to push into uncharted territory. “You see somebody do a trick, you want to learn that trick.

Former Kennedy aides Ted Sorensen and Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. are among those who have said that those bills also would have gotten through had JFK lived.

Aetna's spokeswoman, Anjie Coplin, had me sign a release so she could discuss my situation, then told me what was already obvious: I was denied because of my pre-existing conditions. She never addressed my request for a further explanation of what made my ailments actuarially scary.
European markets advanced Friday, buoyed by solid gains for the mining sector as metal prices rose once again.
Time is critical in education. No time to goof off.
The Suns have the potential to grow with much of it pegged on center Robin Lopez, the rotation's lone true big man. The second unit is younger and must be a difference-maker like last season.
"He’s one of those (players) that we need to get a lot of fitness work done," Spencer said. "Since we made the bid to Tolima, he wasn’t training with the first group and (he) lost a little bit of fitness. The quicker we get him back into camp, the better."

Madison High School. What comes to your mind when you hear this name? Pregnant girls, students skipping class, druggies -- or all of the above? Rumor has it that Madison isn't even a school but just a place for reckless teens who've hit rock bottom.
In Orange County, the vault within the vault for Republicans, Romney raised $706,000 in his first three months as an announced candidate in 2007. In his first three months as a candidate this time around, Orange County accounted for less than half of that, $316,000, his FEC filing shows.

All of the courses cover age-appropriate tactics and techniques for playing the game, and how to teach in a fun, effective way.
Etan's parents waited 22 years to declare him dead, most likely in hope that he was still alive. Their loss, like that of so many others with missing family members, may still be ambiguous, despite publicly acknowledging his death. Madeleine's parents may have their own dreams of reunification fanned by investigators, although in some cases the opposite happens. The Dugard case, in particular, might well cause any parents to consider whether their missing daughter or son might show up five, 10, or even 18 years later.
Oberst worked on arts and culture issues, historic preservation and, like Hayes, on hunger concerns.
The benefit of moving school elections is economic: Rolling the cost of April elections — where turnout hovers between 10 and 15 percent — into the general election, where turnout is much higher, saves money.

Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson of DeKalb County, who serves on the Armed Forces Committee, said he agrees that the defense cuts are too severe -- but he would rather see them offset by closing tax loopholes for corporations and wealthy individuals.
"How am I going to do that?" he asked.
Why? Because story counts don't mean anything. The job is to cover the news -- what's happening, who's lying, who's telling the truth -- not to try to write the same number of words about each.
New York was unable to prosecute the majority of the cases because the state's statute of limitations was only six years at the time. It has since been expanded. Ohio's current statute of limitations in felony sexual assault cases is 20 years, but cases have to be prosecuted depending on the law at the time of the attack.

"I had no idea where he was," Oosthuizen said. "Where I stood from, when the ball came out, it looked like a curve ball. Unbelievable shot. That shot he hit definitely won him the tournament."
Pau Gasol's passing was as helpful as the Lakers imagined against a Denver defense overloading wherever the ball stopped, and Gasol finished with eight assists, eight rebounds and 13 points. Bryant put on a fourth-quarter surge to finish with 31 points, but he shot just 11 of 24 from the field.
There is no forensic evidence in the case, and the surveillance video doesn't show the crime itself.

Bathe in bleach. Patients with eczema often have staphylococcal infections on their skin, the bacteria that causes and worsens infection. Giving children diluted bleach baths significantly reduced the severity of their eczema and prevented flare-ups by killing the bacteria on the body arms and legs, according to researchers from Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Interestingly, the face, which was not submerged in the bath, did not improve. In the study, the children soaked in about half a cup of bleach in a full, standard-size tub, twice a week for about five to 10 minutes.
Robertson was motivated to join the Revive! program, in part, by weight gain. But she was more focused on being leaner and stronger. She doesn't weigh herself often, relying instead on how she feels and how her clothes fit. She's gone from a size 12 to a size ten, sometimes an eight. Further motivation was provided by family history. Her mother first went into full cardiac arrest at age 44 and died seven years later.

• Woodson may be opposed to bringing Stoudemire off the bench, but the numbers say that could be the smart move, wrote Jim Cavan of the "Off the Dribble" blog: "A quick look at the numbers shows that – with the team’s second-leading scorer (Stoudemire) unable to play and Anthony playing primarily at the four – the Knicks’ overall offensive efficiency actually improved, jumping from just over 100 to 109.6 over the last 15 games (as cited above, roughly what it was during Woodson’s first six games)... To put that in perspective, if the Knicks had maintained that clip throughout the year, they would currently be a good point-and-a-half ahead of current N.B.A. leader San Antonio."

Unfortunately, for homeowners, the cost of this insurance is generally much higher than insurance they could purchase independently. Some price premium may be justified, but often the price difference amounts to gouging. Why? All too often, loan servicers get financial benefits from the insurers.

I wish the state volleyball tournament used double elimination instead of pool play. There are two fundamental problems with pool play. First, matches 9-12 could be irrelevant, pairing two teams already eliminated or two teams already guaranteed to advance.

What would you think about having volleyball use a double-elimination format instead of pool play?

As Mr. Einhorn's own firm prospered, he could have jammed far more money into his Allied Capital short position, determined to prevail by brute force. He didn't. He kept 3% of assets in that position but invested most of his money in other ideas that worked out better. Such discipline, we come to realize, is what distinguishes the wisest long-term investors from obstinate short-timers who veer between triumph and ruin.

The markets will not have it any other way, and they have France in a corner. In order to cover the interest on its existing debt plus this year's budget deficit, France must borrow almost one-fifth of its entire gross domestic product this year, and the same again next year. Most of that enormous sum must be borrowed from foreign lenders, so Hollande cannot afford to frighten them by radically changing the austerity policy he inherits from Sarkozy.

Rondo bumped Davis with 41 seconds left in the Celtics’ Game 1 loss to the Hawks Sunday after being assessed a technical foul for arguing a call. He was immediately whistled for a second technical and ejected. Rondo said he was upset because officials called teammate Brandon Bass for a foul, instead of awarding a jump ball, during a scrum for a loose ball with Hawks forward Josh Smith.

Creating new lab schools around the country and training more teachers to innovate will take time. Meanwhile, what the parents of future innovators do matters enormously. My interviews with parents of today's innovators revealed some fascinating patterns. They valued having their children pursue a genuine passion above their getting straight As, and they talked about the importance of "giving back." As their children matured, they also encouraged them to take risks and learn from mistakes. There is much that all of us stand to learn from them.

Part of the move to capped data is to get consumers accustomed to the idea that data isn't a limitless resource. If carriers didn't move to usage-based data plans while rolling out newer speedy data networks, the networks would get abused, Zachary Investment Research analyst Patrick Comack said. And while the pricing of Verizon's network is higher than AT&T's, its service is speedier, so it can charge a premium for now.

Relatives and friends paint backdrops on cardboard refrigerator boxes, make costumes and operate lights and microphones to help bring the 30- to 40-minute productions to life.
Price's use of bright color on clay forms was a distinctive feature of his work. Sometimes he achieved it through the use of acrylic paint rather than fired glazes, a method that upset ceramic purists but satisfied the artist's determination to follow his interests. The technique has reached new heights since the 1990s. Sexy, bulbous forms are painted black, layered with lush acrylic colors and then sanded to reveal the under-paint in richly textured spots of brilliant hues. Some sculptures carry 70 thin coats of paint.
That was a gunless crime, of course. Rahm Emanuel drew notice last week with a fresh frontal assault on the other kind. It makes him a pariah to a lot of downstaters and could leave a fellow Democrat, Gov. Pat Quinn, in a pickle.

Now, on Monday, nearly every Republican in the Senate voted to block what’s called the Buffett Rule. Think about this. The Buffet Rule says if you make a $1 million or more -- I'm not saying you got $1 million -- let's say you're a small business person, you saved, you worked, and after 10, 20, 30 years of working you finally saved up your little nest egg -- that’s not what I'm talking about. I'm saying you make $1 million a year. And we said you should at least pay the same percentage in income tax as middle class families do -- as a teacher or a bus driver. (Applause.) And by doing that, that helps us afford being to say to the 98 percent of families who make $250,000 a year or less, your taxes won't go up.

If he does start wildly increasing spending, France will no doubt see its borrowing costs rise  which could make his policies untenable and prompt a shift back to austerity. It was those rising borrowing costs that eventually forced fellow eurozone nations Greece, Ireland and Portugal to seek bailouts.
"We were more in sync as the game went on," Haren said. "It's a learning process. We got mixed up a few times the first few innings, throwing certain pitches in certain counts, but as the game went on there was less shaking off and more nodding. He's smart. He does his homework. It's not like he's a rookie."

This is getting thin quickly. There was no true No. 3 receiver this year, and leading receiver and team MVP Dane Sanzenbacher is a senior. Take out Posey, and the top receivers returning next year are current freshmen Corey Brown (seven catches, 92 yards) and redshirt freshman Chris Fields (three catches, 22 yards) from Painesville Harvey. It also doesn't look like former Buckeye Duron Carter, who went to community college this year after having academic issues as a freshman, will be returning. That leaves current first-year receivers T.Y. Williams and James Louis, second-year player James Jackson and incoming freshmen Evan Spencer and Devin Smith to enter the fray, with the Buckeyes desperate for some go-to guys to emerge, with Brown the most likely candidate.
"I think it was just execution and they made plays when they needed to and we didn't," said Wildcats quarterback Mickey Inns, who completed 32 of 49 passes for a career-high 407 yards and a pair of touchdowns -- including a 1-yarder to Buddy Saxon and a 33-yarder to Lucas Jepson. "I guess you could just say they adjusted and executed well."

Since then, floodwaters rise quicker and higher than ever before and a fast current rushes between houses. In late August, Tropical Storm Irene swamped the neighborhood in minutes instead of hours.

Turkey says the offshore gas search by the internationally recognized Greek Cypriot government in the island's south flouts the rights of breakaway Turkish Cypriots in the north, and last month began exploratory drilling of its own there. In 2011, Turkey sent a warship-escorted research vessel south of Cyprus, while Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned that his government would "retaliate even more strongly" to any further search for mineral deposits around the island.

The space itself may have a bit more pizzazz, but Hajj’s diner still offers the same hearty breakfast and lunch plates that first captured the city’s attention 16 years ago, when it proved a major step up from Boston’s average greasy spoon. Mike’s pocket-- friendly menu is unique and perhaps even more appealing today than it was in 1996. It stands out amid the trendy, upscale chef-driven boutique restaurants that now largely define South End dining culture. Yet it still offers plenty of culinary street cred in a neighborhood of sophisticated foodies.
Mind you, this was the winning locker room. And there was a buzz of dissatisfaction everywhere, and lots of people mumbling "nine days," which is when these two teams meet again -- that one at the Rose Garden, where Portland will either take better care of the ball early in the game or be run out of the building by a quickly gelling Griffin and Paul.

Teasing out what might have been caused by the spill and what is normal will be tricky, and that's the challenge scientists now face.

It's easy enough to sit still while Mr. Ford, looking weary yet touchingly human, fiddles with binary codes, camera pens and other electronic esoterica.

You have reported that the current council and mayor are so afraid of what people may think that they have deemed it safer not to have resident-led invocations at the beginning of their meetings.

The wine also reaffirms that blended as opposed to varietal wines could be the future in California for traditionally French grape varieties such as viognier and roussanne. In addition to the customary suggestions of flowers and stone fruits in the two varieties, the Cuvée Blanc carries a note of intriguing nutmeg. Viognier can be somewhat heavy and viscous on the palate, but in this instance, the acidity and spine of roussanne gives it surprising silkiness.

The native Brittany oyster — biologically singular and sovereign among varieties — fell prey to gluttony as well as disease, hard winters and predators such as starfish even more voracious than humans, it seems. In the late 19th century they were dying out when a couple of good things happened: French scientist Victor Coste found a way to cultivate them by laying beds made out of tiles for the baby oysters to latch onto; the technique did not affect the taste because oysters are sedentary, equally good cultivated or naturally bedded.

One funny, early sequence has Poe (played energetically by John Cusack) cussing out an editor at a Baltimore paper who’d replaced his Longfellow screed with one of Longfellow’s own poems. This hurt’s Poe’s pride, and his pocketbook — the destitute Poe never made more than a few dollars from his poems or his fiction, not nearly enough to fund his prodigious liquor bills.

2. Buddy Dyer. Considering that nine months ago, the Orlando mayor was turning himself in at the Orange County Jail, it's somewhat remarkable to see him on this list at all. The scuttled effort to charge him with obscure and previously ignored campaign crimes obviously rattled Dyer, 47. But after treading lightly for his first few months back in office, he re-emerged with force. He is largely credited with changing the skyline of downtown Orlando and invigorating the area with an increasingly wealthy class of people living there. His ambitious goals now include renovating the TD Waterhouse Centre and Citrus Bowl, and building a performing-arts center. It's a lot to bite off. But our panelists respect him for trying and have kept him in second place.

Efforts to get patients to shed extra pounds have produced weight loss in the short term but fatter patients in the long run as weight is regained, Braverman said.

Some modern spiders still build their orb webs using the primitive cribellate silk, however. That has caused researchers to wonder whether the ancestors of those spiders, and the ancestors of spiders that make orb webs using gluey capture silk, each independently came up with the idea for orb webs. Blackledge's research has ruled that out. The orb web evolved only once, he and his team found, and after it did, spiders proliferated.

By moving up seven pounds, Cunningham was able to have Alexander do things in camp the team couldn't do in the past. With the dining shackles removed, Cunningham brought in a nutrition service to work with his fighter and could embark on a strength-training program.

The last two fights were not the best examples of Alexander's work and, with a victory potentially pushing him toward bigger and bigger fights, he's eager to win and show he's an attractive and appealing fighter.

And when Hugo finishes the repair of the automaton, a trip to the library and a run-in with a film historian (Michael Stuhlbarg) leads them to a shocking discovery that solves the many mysteries of the film, but also opens up another chapter: Scorsese recreates the creation of motion pictures, and it is every bit as magical as the people making them believe it to be.
James also believes table games tend to attract more middle and upper class visitors who potentially have more disposable income. The result: more revenue.

“The thing is, when you lose games, the hard thing to do is to talk after games, because you are pissed at the game and the way things are going,’’ McMillan said. “In situations like that, we have to stay together and work it out. It’s on us, it’s not on anyone else. Everything is on us, and what is happening, as far as winning or losing, we win the games together and we lose the games together.’’
A: Rady Children's hospital was one of the first organizations we got involved with. They have always been close to our heart in regards to the amazing work they do for children that suffer serious injuries, diseases, cancers, all sorts of thing. I would say that the Friends of Scott was an organization that we identified six or seven years ago and what they do, just as far as providing support for families and patients dealing with cancer, is incredible. The Armed Services YMCA, certainly we know about the strong military presence here, and to help support an organization that supports so many military families has been truly an honor. And the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the work that they do in raising awareness and funding to find a cure for such a debilitating disease… I can truly say that these are four very respected and deserving organizations.

CONCACAF will hold its qualifying tournament this month.
Honestly, were there any groundbreaking revelations? Of course it was disappointing that the Rangers marched into Comerica Park and took three out of four from the Tigers. But anybody who thinks four games in April will have any impact at all on what happens in October has clearly never watched any baseball before. The Tigers took two out of three from the Rangers last April at Comerica and finished 6-3 against them for the season. That didnt seem to help too much when the two teams met up in the ALCS, did it?

Blame is broad. Stiff environmental and workplace legal hurdles magnify the already overall higher costs of doing business in the region. That's not helpful when there's plenty of cheap competition -- in terms of labor and real estate -- both inside and outside the nation.
"But G-20 finance ministers cannot afford to recognize this, mindful as they must be of the potentially destabilizing influence, not only in Europe but in the rest of the world, of any widespread loss of confidence in the euro arrangements," he said.

Insure more people: Raise taxes on hospitals and insurance companies to expand state coverage to cover all uninsured children and 100,000 uninsured adults.
The second major difference discloses the two candidates' perspectives on the role of states and the federal government in mandating the coverage of health care services. Mr. Romney seeks to limit federal and state standards on health insurance. This could mean reversing the Newborn's and Mother's Health Protection Act (which guarantees at least a 48-hour hospital stay after childbirth), the Mental Health Parity Act (which prohibits group health plans from limiting benefits for mental health compared to medical and surgical benefits), and the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (which ensures public access to emergency services regardless of the ability to pay).

I don't think anyone who comes out that early is ready for the pros. What bothers me is everyone wants to blame the kid, but you put that kind of money in front of him, what's he supposed to do? If the NBA has such a problem with it, don't draft him. And are we so hypocritical that we can send a man to Afghanistan in the Army at any age, but there's a concern for an age limit for the NBA?

Don't buy too much. The benefit on a long-term care insurance policy is generally structured as a fixed daily amount over a certain period up to a cap. You can typically start the clock on the benefit and begin to access the dollars when you have a "long-term care event," such as breaking a hip or having a stroke, in which doctors expect you to need help with the tasks of daily living for at least 90 days. Kenyon said that many salespeople will try to sell you a policy designed to cover the cost of several years of nursing home care, which averaged $239 a day for a private room in 2011, according to an annual MetLife survey. But you can get a much more affordable policy by structuring a benefit package that also includes time with a home health aide, at $21 an hour nationally by the same survey, or adult day care. In some cases, just 10 to 15 hours of respite care a week can be enough to allow people to remain in their homes.

Through last month, Romney donors were limited to giving $2,500 to the campaign in the primary; they can give another $2,500 for the general election.

The New York Times reported this week that the Romney camp hopes to raise a total of $800 million by election day.

Plenty of analysts say the Standard & Poor's 500, given its much broader list of companies, is a better measure of the market. While the Dow would need a 9 percent rally to reach its all-time high of 14,164.53, the S&P 500 is still 15 percent away.

Steiner illustrates the trend in O.C. judicial elections: A mid-career deputy D.A. identifies a judge who is retiring, secures his or her endorsement, publicly stakes out the seat and then sets about fundraising. Any non-prosecutor thinking about challenging not only has to overcome the deputy D.A.'s solid-gold ballot title but the sheer momentum. Few have the resources or inclination, and thus the civil and criminal-defense bars generally must rely on a gubernatorial appointment to get their ilk into the black robe.

The fact that Len Stone was supported by the Pacifica Police in the last election is entirely beside the point. He was elected to represent the whole community, all of us, and that appears to be exactly what he is doing, and in very difficult circumstances. Sounds like almost the opposite of "shameful" to me. He may have lost Mr. Mercurio's vote, but his thoughtful, business-like, even-handed approach has won him many others.
Romney also said Obama is being coy about his long-term plans for a missile defense system in Europe and other issues. He said now is not the time for a "hide and seek" strategy by a president seeking a second term.

P Steve Weatherford. NBC just barely missed a great moment after his punt in the second half when he slapped the Pats’ Matthew Slater on his derriere right after the ball was downed. Slater, to my surprise, didn’t do a thing. “I’m like a kid out there,” Weatherford said of his energy level in general. “It’s a game and that’s how I play it. When I’m able to have fun, I play well. I’ve had fun this entire year and I think it showed. … We’re enjoying the ride and that’s kind of an element I bring to the specialist’s group, that youthful joy of the game.” Yeah, that and consistency, which is why he’ll soon have a nice long-term deal to stay here.

The animal rights activist has led a volunteer effort to trap stray cats in Montclair, neuter or spay them and then release them, a humane way of dealing with feline overpopulation, Reynolds said. Since 2004, the program has stopped 750 cats from reproducing.
Tim Burton and muse Johnny Depp appear to have distilled the strangeness of TV's 1966-71 gothic soap into an even kitchier brew. The year is 1972, and centuries after a curse that robbed him of everything, vampire Barnabus Collins (Depp) returns to his estate to find his descendants a mess of neuroses and the witch who cursed him still feeling scorned. Helena Bonham Carter — Burton's other muse and mate — portrays the Collins' family shrink. (May 11, PG-13)

Out on the stump, Gov. John Kasich loves talking taxes—specifically about how he thinks people in Ohio pay too much in them.
Acito's new play, a touching comedy about, among other things, gay penguins in a New York zoo, is called "Birds of a Feather." Rosenstock's play spins a multilayered tale about desire and love out of the Greek myth of the Spartan queen Leda being seduced by Zeus in the form of a swan, and to keep our "family newspaper" credentials, let's paraphrase its title as "99 Ways to Romance a Swan."
And so it happened several weeks ago that an actor portraying Romney was shown on the national satire show at a make-believe campaign stop, telling an audience that, "The only place that has truly ever felt like home is right here: East St. Louis, Illinois."

Other recent research has suggested that men with a lower ratio have a more symmetrical face and are more attractive to women, a phenomenon known as the "sexy ratio." And just last year, researchers from Warwick University and the Institute of Cancer Research in Britain reported that a man's risk of developing prostate cancer is related to the ratio of the two digits. Men whose index finger in longer than their ring finger were found to be one-third less likely to develop prostate cancer.
The Jacobsens shelled out the six-figure sum even though they already own another fractional interest at the property that they bought for $182,000 in 2009. But that unit doesn't have a guaranteed view, and with the regatta approaching, "we needed more time and it was an opportunity to lock in the perfect view," says Dr. Jacobsen, 67 years old.
Part of the reason for the mistrust of the federal government's ability to manage comprehensive reform is that the nature of immigration across the southern border has changed. In years past, groups of illegal aliens crossing the border tied to human smuggling or drug cartels were the exception to the rule. Today, such ties are the rule. The vast majority of illegal border crossers now have paid to be smuggled across, and an increasing number of these crossers are carrying drugs to subsidize the cost of their passage.

The Quakes have sold 20,000 tickets for a June 30 game against the Los Angeles Galaxy at Stanford Stadium. They expect to attract more than 40,000. The team had 41,000 at Stanford last year for a matchup against the New York Red Bulls but had sold only 10,000 tickets by early May.
Cynic that I am, when I first heard of the school's crisis I assumed that the city had decided that librarians were superfluous in the Internet Age—that kids, those svengalis of the keyboard, knew how to surf the web better than adults and were capable of finding their own books and researching their term papers with clicks of a mouse.
"We get several thousand pounds of produce every week," he said.
Boxleitner was the single most impressive individual in Thursday's four games. And it wasn't even close. Maybe that has a lot to do with Oakville's defense, but the guy was everywhere making plays. He was outstanding.
Afterward, we headed up to the mini-golf course. It's not fancy, but the kids loved it. Then we hopped on a little train that runs through the campground. Most days, you pull up to the ranger station and go "wake up" Yogi, who is sleeping at a pic-i-nic table (I can't tell you how many dads have mastered the Yogi voice). On our day, he was already up when we got there, but my kids didn't mind a bit.
Maybe we need to hum a few bars to jog our memories.

Next to the hotel was a working blacksmith shop that dates from 1750 — operated, like the visitor center and tours, by the Historic Bethlehem Partnership — where a smithy toiled among the embers in the gloom of failing daylight.
According to a report from the American Academy of Pediatrics, parents are missing the mark when it comes to routine dental care for babies. Dentists recommend kids get their first check up before their first birthday. "At an age one visit, it's not all about getting the child into the dental chair and looking at the teeth, that's part of it," said Dr. Hans Reinemer. "It's a lot about educating the parent talking about nutrition, talking about preventive measures, and so forth."

Q: I feel Hoboken has a great music scene at least from the musician’s point of view. I can’t speak for the audience. The musicians and bands here in Hoboken stick together and gig together not just locally but out of town. I think the problem today is many that go to bars couldn’t care less for interesting or innovative live music. We are living in the mp3-cellphone-Internet world where many would rather stare at their cell phones then experience the physical world around them. This is also how most people today prefer their music source: Compressed mp3s on their cell phones rather than a kick-ass, thunderous, epic sound of a live band digging deep into their souls and spilling blood from their hearts all over the stage. I think some nights if I lit myself on fire or hung myself on stage, many bar goers would continue their Facebook status updates and not notice. But I don’t want to sound like cynic, I still love playing for the few hopeless romantics in the audience.
If we don't enforce laws governing private American businesses' unethical dealings with or in other countries, then we don't have a leg to stand on when we question other countries' brutal treatment of their own people, much less enforce our own ethics laws at home.

The political shift dashes between $228 million and $275 million projected in federal funding and millions already spent, including $850,000 from Clackamas County for a draft environmental impact statement, $1 million from Portland and $1.65 million from Lake Oswego, which includes a $1.5 million loan to TriMet to lead the project.
The quick take: The key is to find wines that are fruity, softer, bright and less tannic. So the hands-down winner - if you've read a Thanksgiving wine story before, you're already mouthing the answer - is Pinot Noir. Also: Beaujolais, or other wines made from the Gamay Noir grape. With too much oak, Merlot can be overwhelming, but plusher ones can offer red fruit and pleasant tea aromas that cut through the bird's richness. Or go the other way - look for more robust wines with age on them that highlight the savory notes in the gravy and meat. Skip aged Burgundies here; they need something more subtle. Try older Cabernet, or perhaps a good aged Bordeaux or Brunello.
Meanwhile, there's a chance to win the top spot in the Western Conference. Vancouver's come-from-behind win last night will make it tougher, but the opportunity still exists. On top of the team's priority list the final three games, however, should be getting its game back in order and finding more chemistry among the players who have recently returned.
Good to have you back this week for some chattin'. Hope you were able to use the week off to catch some big fish.
The Post, a student newspaper in Athens, Ohio, quoted Ohio basketball coach John Groce in February as saying the reference was "kind of disrespectful" to the Bobcats. Groce was an assistant under Matta at Ohio State before taking the Bobcats' head coaching job.

Caesars Entertainment Corp., the world's largest casino operator, applied Friday for the license to run the slot machine parlor proposed for Baltimore, while three developers will compete for the opportunity to run a casino in Western Maryland.
Since Bernie confesses, the film's central conflict is about his punishment rather than his guilt. What is uncontested is that Mrs. Nugent and the town didn't get along, and there is acid on her neighbors' tongues as they talk about her and try to explain why she and Bernie became so close. Though he accompanied her on trips abroad and took care of her financial affairs, no one seems to believe it was about the money. That Bernie was "light in his loafers," as one man puts it, is about all anyone can come up to explain why the young man and the old widow became so close. MacLaine drapes an irritating arrogance around her character like a shroud, making it absolutely believable why many in Carthage didn't exactly consider her killing to be a crime.
Since cost is only one factor in looking at private and public colleges, "families should consider a broad range of institutions" based on the right fit for their student and "then make a decision based on the whole picture," Ms. Baum says.
The Illinois Association of School Boards says transportation spending has been slashed 42 percent since 2010.
The cooking is largely well executed, though we spotted a few inconsistencies with the shrimp, or camarones. If it's cooked too long, shrimp can be chewy, even rubbery. When it's perfect, the bite is clean and tender. The camarones à la diabla  shrimp cooked in a fiery sauce, was a disappointment because the sauce was actually sweeter than it was hot, and the ample pieces of shrimp were all on the tough side. For $11.95, which is the highest price on the entire menu, that's a significant misstep.
The downside to staying in the cabin was that we had to drive or ride a shuttle (which took as long as 10 minutes) to get to the amusement park or water park. In nice weather, we could have walked.

The offensive line needs to gel, and find some semblance of consistency. The outside receivers need to stop worrying about getting hit and catch balls. Quarterback Darron Thomas needs to stop reading all the preseason mags touting how great he is and start hitting open receivers. And whichever glutton told LaMichael James to gain 15-20 pounds (it apparently makes him more NFL ready?) should be forced to eat nothing but lard this week.
In addition to the governor's race, several congressional races considered key to control of the House of Representatives are also viewed as tossups. That heightens the pressure on the campaigns to motivate supporters to vote by the close of Tuesday's polls.

Aged tamari gives the dish an interesting sweet, rich edge that makes it more wine friendly. Grilled Cobia ($27) nests around Tokyo turnips, broccolini, nuts and sour cherry nicoise olive tapenade.

Coates, though, will say the bottom line is not the only factor in deciding whether to host an event like the Grand Prix. There are incalculable benefits, those "priceless" MasterCard-commercial memories that become a part of the city's culture.

Every Greek company that owes money in euros — to a foreign supplier, say — would see those debts grow much heavier compared with the weaker new drachma. Many would go bankrupt. Greeks with the weaker drachma would have to pay more to travel abroad or buy foreign goods.

FROM THE START
5 Christina Munoz Texas A&M
I grew up in Muskegon and graduated from Muskegon High School in 1977. That means in 1971-72 I was in the seventh grade at Bunker Junior High. I had always loved to run, and I was pretty fast. I remember in seventh grade that I really wanted to run track, but at the time there was no girls track team -- only a boys team.

As the session at Triple B Clays in South El Monte winds down, Hubbard reflects. As an avid fly-fisher, part of her email address is "reelwoman," she teaches fly-tying at Bob Marriott's Fly Fishing in Fullerton.

"There are a lot of really thuggish individuals associated with the nativist movement in Arizona," said Mark Potok, editor of the Southern Poverty Law Center's magazine Intelligence Report.

He had a long history of violence, and it finally came to this kind of violence."
"The school board and the district have thrown out a tremendous number of planned changes and potential changes," said Parrington, adding that he would be surprised to see the entire plan enacted at once. "Any one of them by itself can take up much of the spring to lay out."

I'm a sucker for creamy fresh cheeses in these main-course salads, partly because they add a pillowy lightness to the mix and because they look pretty next to colorful produce. Salty and briny cheeses are good choices for adding extra punch, such as feta cheese with the koftas. Fresh goat cheese is subtle enough to go with delicate frisee, and its acidity offsets the nectarines. Salted ricotta, or ricotta salata, next to grilled eggplant mirrors the flavors in pasta alla Norma, a Sicilian pasta dish of eggplant, tomato, ricotta salata and basil.
At 8:30 a.m. April 12, the Food Providers will meet at the foundation behind the Mike Conley Hospice House on Oakley Seaver Boulevard, not far from the Cooper Memorial Library.

Supporters are back again this year with Senate Bill 2. And while the balance of power in the statehouse hasn't changed — Democrats control the Senate and Republicans control the House — they hope the political landscape has. That's due in large part to Coloradans for Freedom, which earlier this year formed with a mission to bring together and provide support to Republicans who support civil unions.

That argument struck a much more powerful chord than the Nevada Democrats expected, not only with the compulsive petition-signers online, but also with pillars of the Democratic political establishment. Many Democratic professionals believe that Fox will continue to provide an uncritical platform for almost any charge the right can dredge (Drudge?) up against the 2008 Democratic contenders.
Each bouquet requires a lot of brooches. They need to overlap so the foam ball underneath doesn't show. Diehl wires each brooch and sticks the wires all the way through the ball. The wires become the bouquet's stems.
"Ultimately, it's a business," he said. "For people to say, 'Gee, it's not fair this person would come in and make this offer' is silly.

So we became friends. Such close friends, in fact, that I handled all of Sparky's personal business affairs. Neither Sparky nor I liked the sound of the word "agent." We tried "manager" for a while. And then "adviser." Finally, when telling people about our relationship, we settled on the word "friend." The truth is always simple.
With gang violence down, city officials are looking to secure lasting change in South L.A., in part through a large injunction targeting six gangs in a 13.7-square-mile area straddling the Harbor Freeway. Critical to the success of that campaign is the work of gang interventionists, who act as liaisons between police and gangs -- "like the social workers in the places no one else will go," said Brian Center, executive director of A Better LA, a nonprofit that combats violence in South L.A. and funds 26 interventionists.

By the time we settled on the third-floor bar with its tall, skintight-catsuit-clad femme fatale barkeep and overly weathered couches, I couldn't decide if I was underdressed or overdressed (read: too much clothing on), or if I should just shut up and drink. I chose the last one. Sitting with Sparks, Chung and a cute boy, there was no want of attention by some of the most beautiful, jaw-droppingly sexy, curvy, femmed-up girls I'd ever seen.

Lotterman (Richard Jenkins), the harried editor, hires Kemp despite his obviously inflated resume and lies about his drinking, which Kemp describes with a straight face as "the upper end of social."

Any team can get on a roll in the playoffs, and maybe the Wings will. But it's fair to ask: Why should they suddenly be able to win on the road when they only did so 17 times all season, and five of those times required a shoot-out? Why should their power play suddenly start clicking when its ineffectiveness has been the story of the season?

øYou could try all you wanted, but you could never stare down the great Pat Summitt.
øNovak Djokovic will win the French Open. Remember, we did say bold. A year ago we predicted that Djokovic would break the Nadal-Federer duopoly and win a hardcourt Slam title. That prediction, though not wrong, looks positively feeble in the wake of Djokovic's epic 2011 (including three Slam titles). The one he didn't win was Roland Garros- and now it's the only one he doesn't have - but he was oh-so-close. Djokovic lost, narrowly, in the semifinals to an at-his-best Roger Federer. A final showdown against Rafael Nadal would have been no easy task, of course, but he had just whipped Rafa in straight sets in consecutive clay-court finals (Madrid, Rome) and he had most definitely, to borrow a phrase, Occupied Nadal (Rafa's head, anyway). Unless Nadal truly has exorcised Djokovic, he is vulnerable again.

Clinton voters, the women who have been with her since the pageboy 'do, will stray back and forth several times before the election cycle is over, and some of them will settle on Palin. Who knows why? Some will have carefully constructed, well-considered reasons for their decision. Some of those reasons will be void because they're based on bad information. And some will choose her because she seems like the kind of woman who doesn't give a damn about wearing white shoes after Labor Day.
Clemens' legal team used the book Wednesday to try to raise doubts about an old, torn label that Radomski said was used for a shipment of human growth hormone to Clemens' home about 10 years ago. Clemens' Houston address is on the label — a seemingly tangible connection between the seven-time Cy Young Award winner and performance-enhancing drugs — and the name on the label is that of Brian McNamee, Clemens' former strength coach.

"We have to identify the gaps," she said. "Are the gaps based on race, on socioeconomics, or services received? We need to do a root-cause analysis to determine what's the cause, why do they exist, and what are the barriers that prevent us from moving forward? Then we have to put systems and structures in place so we're giving teachers opportunities to meet the students where they are, to take them to the next level."

That is what will be on my mind these next few days, as we pray for God to "carry out in tranquility the plan of salvation." Meditating on the pain and the glory of the Cross, I will not try to place the burden of blame elsewhere; I will instead focus on my own need for reconciliation and peace as I pray for the wisdom to let God be God.

Sandy Kos, outgoing president of San Clemente Aquatics, hailed the new aquatics center where the city recreation department will offer swim classes, water aerobics, lap swimming and other programs currently presented at San Clemente's Ole Hanson Beach Club, but now with much more space, relieving pressures on the smaller Avenida Pico beach club. That facility dates back to 1928 and soon will close for a year-long renovation, then will reopen and operate concurrently with the new facility.

Democrats have called Christie's decision to eliminate New Jersey's entire contribution to the 58 family planning clinics insensitive to women, and economically foolish, noting it turns down $9 in federal funding for every $1 the state spends.

"I feel like it will be a battle under the boards," Nichols said. "We played Taylor Manuel (Incarnate Word) twice and faced Sadie Stipanovich (Westminster). ... It is literally an uphill battle.

Simmons explained he knew he was fit to enter when he recently finished off two pizza steaks and then ate a whole pizza.
Mets lefty Johan Santana doesn't throw as hard as he used to, his fastball hovering at 89-90 mph. But his sleight-of-hand changeup and nasty slider still make him a formidable foe. Santana has faced the Rockies just twice in his career, but he's 2-0 and was dominant both times. Indeed, the Rockies haven't scored a run off the big lefty in 16 innings against him. Then again, Santana has never pitched at Coors Field, so this could be an eye-opener for him. Troy Tulowitzki has had some success vs. Santana (3-for-7, one double), but Jason Giambi (4-for-18, six strikeouts) and Ramon Hernandez (4-for-19, four strikeouts) have struggled.

“I think he could change our style of play with how I've seen him play: uptempo for the most part where he is pushing and attacking in a spread offense. So these runners on our team – Gerald (Wallace), Nic (Batum) and L.A. (LaMarcus Aldridge) – should benefit and complement his style of play,'' McMillan said. “But pick-and-roll basketball is so big in the NBA, and that has been somewhat missing from our offense for the last, I would say year or so. But now, if the offense breaks down, I expect to get something out of Raymond with the two-man game.''

The Answer: I certainly hoped I would. I started with the company almost right out of college and just loved it right away. I started in that customer service dispatch area. So very quickly I realized this is really a unique service. It is absolutely a high-end service, something that I would want to be associated with, the people here are excellent, and I always thought, "Gosh, I would like to run it at some point in time." I worked my way up the ladder, and when we were acquired by FedEx in 1998, I knew for sure I wanted to stay with the company.

In the four years since her death, Tanner's care is all that pulls David through each day. He doesn't need to work; the royalties from "The Serial Killer's Protégé" provide a more than comfortable living. When his publisher, Paul Sheppard, shows up at the door, David's first instinct is to turn him away. He has little interest in the mock-up Paul shows him, a new book titled "The Lesser Mysteries of Greater Cleveland." The book would be a collection of David's existing crime writing but for one new story: David would solve the mystery of the death of the man from Primrose Lane.

Personal Safety: The No.1 concern for anyone clearing land is personal safety. From small nicks and cuts to gaping wounds and sprains, clearing land is not only physical, but can involve the use of dangerous equipment.

Voegeli acknowledges that the requirement that people have coverage is consistent with John Stuart Mill’s dictum that limiting the freedom of some (in this case the uninsured) is only appropriate when it avoids their harming others (in this case through making others pay for the cost of covering their care). This requirement that others pay is called the "cost shift," and it is borne, in particular, by California businesses that pay thousands more than their international competitors on health coverage for their employees. Voegeli concludes, though, that "under the guise of preventing cost shifting … Obamacare commits cost shifting" by requiring people to pay for more of the care or protection of others than is absolutely necessary.

2. When do you take 3-D scans? While a 3-D scan -- called a dental CBCT (cone-beam computed tomography) -- shows terrific, cross-sectional images of your teeth and jaw, the radiation dose can be four to 67 times higher than conventional X-rays.

As one might guess, most homosexuality "separations," as they are called in the Air Force, occurred in the first few weeks of basic training, before the more costly technical training began. And many of these removals would have occurred in any case, since they were the result of unacceptable conduct and not just a declaration of sexual orientation. In any case, it would have made no material difference in Air Force training costs if we had retained all 3,000 people.

Part of the "Sea Lions" show aims at whale trainers, one of whom humorously frolics along outside the pool while a walrus goes through the same motions a whale does in a "One Ocean" segment.

It turns out he also orchestrates home crowds -- not just his players.
Instead of booyahs for buh-byes, the celebrity coaches try offering bon mots of encouragement to those they have just shed like excess tonnage from their team. Blake Shelton promised at the top of the show that "It's going to get brutal," and maybe it will be for the coaches. That's why some of that brutality should come directly from them.

Yum's Asian Bistro has opened in Charles Village on the corner of Charles and 25th, where New No Da Ji was for years and years. Before New No Da Ji (or No Da Ji as it was originallly known), there was Love's, which had been on that corner ever longer, for about 50 years beginning in 1942.
The brief, the primary authors of which are IJ’s Elizabeth Price Foley and Steve Simpson, says ObamaCare is the first time Congress has used its power to regulate commerce to produce a law “from which there is no escape.” And “coercing commercial transactions” — compelling individuals to sign contracts with insurance companies — “is antithetical to the foundational principle of mutual assent that permeated the common law of contracts at the time of the founding and continues to do so today.”

A: Yes, that change was made before Turiaf was sidelined, with Bosh and Haslem likely the opening power rotation in the playoffs. In fact, I would not be surprised to see Joel Anthony ahead of Turiaf in the postseason rotation, with Turiaf possibly to turn into this year's Erick Dampier when it comes to the playoffs. Haslem's shooting Wednesday was a step forward. Now he has to get his rebounding to come around to the level it was when he was playing as a reserve.

The concept included Crystal Square, which would be built behind the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and feature a pavilion with glass structures facing the water. In the winter, its doors would close to shield people from the harsh winds and cold while still providing a view of the lake. Streets would also be designed to turn the area into a four-season playground. Roads would jog, instead of being built on a straight grid, to block frequent and strong winds.
He also seems to recognize the importance of this third season in the big leagues for himself as a developing hitter and - in particular - a developing fielder at a critical position. And for what he means to a franchise in the midst of the biggest organizational overhaul in its long history.

The pitch for understanding and acceptance always was at the heart of the show, especially in such numbers as Georges' "Song on the Sand" and Albin's defiant "I Am What I Am," which would become an anthem for the gay community. But with the original production's air of apple-pie wholesomeness, anyone uncomfortable with the bolder aspects could concentrate on the lavish trappings and the soothing traditionalism of the treatment.

The state has seen several high-profile bullying cases in recent years. In 2010 a $10 million federal lawsuit alleged that Howard County school administrators did not do enough to protect a student who was being bullied. The student, a sixth-grader at the time, suffered post-traumatic stress disorder after being assaulted by "gangs of male, young adolescent peers," according to the lawsuit. The suit was dismissed before trial; that decision is under appeal.

Jose Luis Gutierrez, the leftist mayor of Ecatepec, in the central state of Mexico, where Ixtapan de la Sal is also located, said his 1,600 police officers are far better positioned than federal authorities to catch drug suspects.

April 25, 2012 — Members of the Baltimore Police Department's Warrant Apprehension Task Force arrest Michael Johnson at his girlfriend's apartment. The arrest came about 11:30 p.m., according to his attorney, Neverdon, who alleged police expedited the bust "because they don't want to ruin the credibility of the case" based on Nicholson's suspension. The police union president defends Nicholson, saying, "This shows now only how good a cop he is, but how important his family is to him. The same effort and energy he put into locating Phylicia Barnes, you can see him doing the same for his daughter. That's the kind of cop we want to patrol the streets of Baltimore."

However, this move is by no means permanent because the Giants know Diehl's versatility means he can move back outside at a moment's notice. And David Baas, who agreed to an undisclosed contract yesterday, can play guard and center as well. So if Beatty struggles and the Giants want to bring back O'Hara and/or Seubert at some point, they can easily do so to juggle the line. Kevin Boothe, who agreed to a two-year contract this week, also provides flexibility.

And if LTE—which I consider the only true 4G network in the U.S.—matters to you, bear in mind that AT&T offers that service in just 31 markets, versus 203 for Verizon.

The chief architect of Monday's mischief appears to have been Mr. Miller. He was insistent on moving legislation this year to expand gambling to a sixth site in Maryland, either at Rosecroft Raceway or National Harbor in his nativePrince George's County, and to authorize table games throughout the state. The matter was the subject of little attention or debate until a gambling bill sailed out of the Senate two weeks ago. Despite the fact that the legislation had little, if any, connection to state revenues and expenditures in the next fiscal year, Mr. Miller insisted that it be considered in concert with the tax and spending bills that were must-do items for the General Assembly. Senate negotiators only agreed to a compromise with the House on income tax increases after House leaders agreed to bring a gambling bill up for a vote. As that bill's prospects dimmed on the House floor, the Senate's consideration of the tax measures slowed, and time ran out.

As a mediating presence between past and future, the Gonzalez Goodale design manages well enough, and a collection of public art woven into the campus effectively engages the hotel's complex history without having to mimic its architectural forms.

The dominant formal gesture is a series of oversized entryways wrapped in zinc.

If a manager was to respond to a "better offer" let them go. In this state, and across this country, we still have high unemployment.

Last week, a small but energetic group of artists, writers, curators and other cultural savants from Los Angeles, Guadalajara, Tijuana and Mexico City joined the locals in hopes of adding a new, positive attraction to the area. "Puerto Vallarta Arte Contemporáneo 08," a five-day marathon of art shows, panel discussions, walking tours and public art projects, was the inaugural edition of a contemporary art festival that organizers hope will become an annual event.

For too long, a priest’s collar was more important than the vision and business sense needed to run this institution. And those years of poor leadership and lack of vision have resulted in the current state of affairs.
‘‘Absolutely. That's their call,'' he said after pitching a scoreless inning. ‘‘I've said it from the first day of spring training. I'm going to do what they need me to do and what fits best for the team. And obviously what's best for the team is for me to come into a game like that or get a run up.''
"You should have seen this locker room after the game," said 15-year veteran Marcus Camby. "Guys were cheering and jumping around like we won the NCAA championship. That's a great feeling to be around."

"The postseason is all about the emotion and the intensity of the game and how you handle it," he said. "We have a lot of guys on our team where this is new ground. Are you ready for the stage? Are you ready, knowing that this is going to be the harder than anything you've ever done?"
Macon, Ga., high school world history teacher Jason Williams said he tries to focus his lessons on religious tolerance.

6. "Green." Do a good deed for your favorite handyman and a kindness to the environment by choosing gifts that use less energy, spew less pollution and create less waste. Examples: Cordless, electric yard tools, such as lawnmowers and trimmers are better for the environment than ones that use gasoline. And some tool manufacturers are incorporating sophisticated dust collectors into their power tools to reduce the amount of particulate matter released into the air by drilling, chopping, sanding and grinding. The tools come with micro-filters that nearly eliminate airborne concrete dust.

Created by composer Damon Intrabartolo and lyricist Jon Hartmere Jr., "bare" enjoys a cult following but not the kind of fame associated with, for example, "Spring Awakening." But its similar story is equally powerful, conveyed not only by the director Scott Miller and the actors but through Intrabartolo's romantic pop score, performed with passion by conductor Justin Smolik and the New Line Band.
When stuffing mushrooms, bigger is better. Water-logged mushrooms shrink when cooked, so regular-size white mushrooms can be too small for stuffing. Opt for portobello, large white button or cremini mushrooms.
"Wind and road noise may be pleasantly absent, but that only serves to highlight the creaks and buzzes from other parts of the cabin. We heard squeaks from the dash, rattles from the sunroof and creaks from the glovebox in different test cars at the launch." -- Alisdair Suttie, columnist for The Irish Times
The show is a smart, incisive, 90-minute collage of songs about the Far East, Southeast Asia and the Middle East - drawn from both the Broadway and pop music songbooks, and deftly interspersed with brief interludes of prose and poetry from writers spanning the 11th to the late 20th centuries. What alters or heightens the meaning and message of these pieces is that they are being performed by eight actors whose varied ethnic backgrounds cannot help but put into sharper relief both the naivete and sentimentality - as well as the idealism and satirical bite - of Western artists writing about places and people perceived as "exotic" or at least different.
The project is expected to cost about $2 billion to $4 billion, depending on how many lanes are added and how many interchanges are rebuilt.
In her match with Natalya, who was last seen tagging with The Great Khali in a mixed-tag match as a babyface but was acting like a heel tonight, AJ just snapped. She slapped Natalya and then assaulted her in the corner in pure cat-fight fashion, leading to a disqualification. There wasn't much of a match here, but it's nice to see AJ undergoing some character development.
Mosaic never claims any affinity for local provision, but it still struck me as a little strange to have honeydew and watermelon, albeit in compressed form, in late autumn. My only other objection to the menu was a lack of imagination shown by offering mundane cheeses as part of a cheese plate and by offering raw ahi tuna at all.
The experience isn't unusual. In August, the Federal Trade Commission issued a new warning about time-share scams, which have become increasingly common with the collapse of the vacation real-estate market. In the last year, attorneys general from Missouri and Illinois have sued time-share resale companies and warned consumers to be suspicious of any such firms requiring an upfront fee.
Beale knew Shakur personally. They were both members of the Outlawz, a '90s rap group. Back then, Beale was known as Napoleon, a rapper from Newark. Beale may no longer be working in music — he's now a motivational speaker based in Saudi Arabia — but he's seen Shakur enough in the flesh to know his mannerisms and says the image he saw from online videos looked pretty convincing.

Grammy winner Hill, in her trademark Afro hair style and simple slacks ensemble, seemed in good spirits when she hit the stage just before midnight, 11:52 p.m. Sunday to be exact. She stayed in that mode even while fussing with a jacket that had a huge fur trimming that was nearly her undoing.

We were raised in Middleburg Heights. It was a life-changing experience to volunteer at Urban. I was 19. I'd just joined the Ursulines. I'd never been exposed to diversity. I found myself taking food to homes and finding no adults, and the oldest child was 6 and the youngest was 12 months, and calling the county and working with the families and helping them be who they're called to be.

It's a pretty sure bet that veteran local singer/songwriter Fernando Viciconte never envisioned that the "True Instigator" he summoned via the title of his latest release would be R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck. Yet it was Buck's prodding that got this reluctant talent out of his latest retirement and inspired the full release of the album -- not to mention the recording of the next.

Here's a bit of news to be thankful for: By Thanksgiving next year, the liquid ban may be moot. The Transportation Security Administration announced this month that new, more sophisticated scanning equipment can distinguish between safe and unsafe liquids, rendering the carry-on liquid ban unnecessary.

The danger is that transportation policy will continue to be shaped by elected officials who only look backward and repeat the mistakes of the past.

"I don't think taking a suspension is ever a good thing," Keith said Tuesday. "If you're trying to look for some positives, I guess getting some rest would probably be beneficial in that regard, but I didn't feel like I needed rest. I've been able to play a lot of games every year."

Dating back to rap's early days, when the Englewood-based Sugar Hill label produced hits like the Sugarhill Gang's "Rapper's Delight," and continuing with other success stories such as Queen Latifah, Naughty By Nature, the Fugees and P.M. Dawn -- the state's impact on hip-hop is undeniable. Though it's been a few years since a local emcee has made it to the mainstream, there's still plenty of talent that is unabashedly Jersey.

He simply is a limited player. He cannot make the plays with any regularity needed to win at this level. No one expected him to be playing this much, of course.

Chocolate cake ($7) seems to have won a permanent place among the two dessert offerings. The pie-shaped wedge has a crisp outer shell that gives way to a souffle-like interior; served with lightly whipped cream. Other desserts have included an exceptional creme brulee ($6); an almond, lemon and ricotta cake ($7) with big chunks of nuts and a dollop of whipped cream; and one of the best variations of tres leches cake ($7) I've had. This one was so good because it wasn't overly sweet and was balanced by a subtle saltiness that enhanced all the components.

A team of researchers led by Dr. Charis Eng, chairwoman and founding director of the Clinic's Genomic Medicine Institute, recently connected a second gene with Cowden syndrome -- a genetic condition that affects about 1 in 200,000 people -- throwing open the door for even more people to be definitively diagnosed with the disease.
First, most millionaires pay high taxes. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the richest 1 percent of Americans have an average tax rate, including payroll taxes, of 29.5 percent. (By contrast, the tax rate for the poorest 40 percent of Americans is 7 percent.) The same top 1 percent pays about 28 percent of all federal taxes. Buffett and some other super-wealthy are outliers, because their income is mostly from dividends and capital gains, taxed at 15 percent.
Boland, who received confidential legal settlements from Smyth's Norbertine order in 2006 and from the Catholic Church last year, told the BBC that he and his parents received verbal assurances that Smyth would be barred from further contact with children.

Across the country, real estate agents are reporting a rise in traffic at open houses. But they say buyers are reluctant because of the shellshock they suffered after the free-money machine blew up in everyone's face. The foreclosure epidemic. The plague of employment insecurity.

He was already at a 3-delegate deficit, for example, in the Steubenville area (District 13) and another 3-delegate deficit further south on Ohio's eastern border (District 6), areas where steel workers and others might remember him from his days serving Pennsylvania.

Though the film did well enough to spawn two sequels, Miller told the Salt Lake City Tribune in 2006 that the overall lack of success "extinguished" his interest in film production.

Santorum's right that Romney hasn't offered a distinctive theme for his leadership. He's come across as more of a Mr. Fix-It than a visionary, someone who responds to events rather than pulling the country in a particular direction. But that critique didn't prompt Romney to make a better case for his leadership qualities. Instead, the main thing Santorum seems to have inspired Romney and his supporters to do is spend a lot more money on negative ads.
By the way, Jacobs is Jewish. A journalist. Lives in New York City. He is head down and working in front of a computer screen 60 hours a week. Not exactly a rainbow-twirling hippie yogi from Marin, in other words. So to hear him suggest that the most powerful and life-changing lesson he's ever gleaned is to simply say thanks to every little thing in the world, well, this is sort of curious and wonderful. I'm accustomed to it in the yoga sphere, but in journalism it's, shall we say, unusual.

Going after bad apples in the Bisard case and the police altercation with teenager Brandon Johnson gained Straub limited rewards from the community and intense grief from the FOP.

I'll play psychologist here for a second. It seems that Arrieta, who was overpowering up to that point, lost focus after he threw away a pickoff throw for the second time in the game.

He pitched to nine batters in the fifth and got just one out after retiring 12 consecutive batters.

Statisticians and city supporters call the study flawed. Because it measures only cities, they argue, it unfairly equates tight-boundaried places such as St. Louis with far-more sprawling Sun Belt towns. And even then, they point out, a few neighborhoods with high crime rates end up tarring an entire city as unsafe. Still, such statistical nuances are easily lost on observers from elsewhere, making the whole region look bad.

“I’m obviously a fan of traditionally unsympathetic characters,” says Reitman, who made “Up in the Air,” “Juno” and “Thank You for Smoking.” “But also of finding the humanity in them.

And to never judge her, never ask you for your forgiveness — just simply show you the humanity in her.”

Aloha is popular with a large population who doesn't want to live in a condo high-rise, doesn't have $450,000 to own a McMansion, wants to live close to the action (right smack between Beaverton and Hillsboro) and wants to simply own a slice of the American Dream. A reasonable home.
The program proposed on Friday would more than double what Ameren Missouri was spending on energy efficiency before the cuts, and promises to save its customers 800 million kilowatt-hours a year, an amount of equal to the energy use of 60,000 homes.
But topping 10,000 deaths translates to "a very significant die-off," Cole said, the most the refuge complex has seen in 10 to 15 years. Normally, he said, the deaths are in the hundreds or low thousands. Refuge employees and volunteers collected and incinerated about 5,000 dead birds to thwart spread of the disease.
You can't blame its current leaders, scoutmaster Frank Williamson and chairwoman Bonnie Sawyer. The two have run the troop since day one -- an incredible stretch by any measure.
Show host LL Cool J's neat pivot allowed the assembled industry leaders to mourn Houston while enjoying the night's music.

"There is no policy specific to hugging, and we have not, nor will we be, suspending students for hugging," he said in a written statement.

Trustees are fiduciaries -- responsible for guiding their institutions when they're thriving and nurturing them when they're not. They're also responsible for ensuring transparency. However, transparency doesn't seem to be among the trustees' top priorities, as evidenced by the fact that the minutes for the 2011 meetings have yet to be posted on their website.

Without any interference from me, he eventually gravitated to Super Smash Brothers Brawl and other such "masculine" interests, although I'd like to think that his gentle affection for animals has something to do with my openness at his explorations of himself as a human first, not a G.I. Joe in training.
Providing a single step to go back or cancel an incorrect command is a valuable function for complicated controls. The voice-recognition system doesn't recognize "cancel," an equally vexing oversight.

The legendary weather prevented much of a view beyond a few hundred feet as we ascended farther in that grumbling van, but I hardly felt robbed.The show wasn't in the distance, it was in the changing landscape, which seemed even more dramatic in the gray mist. In a remarkably short time -- probably about 4,500 feet -- the trees disappeared altogether, giving way to squat, scrubby bushes.
In a legal order signed Friday, Steven Chase Brigham, who owns six American Women’s Services clinics in New Jersey, agreed to a temporary suspension of his license as of September 16. The agreement allows Brigham more time to prepare his case regarding an incident last month in which an 18-year-old New Jersey woman was severely injured during an abortion at one of his medical offices in Elkton, Md., according to the order.
The culprit in all this is a giant ridge of high pressure that has parked itself over Northern California and is refusing to budge. The system has pushed storms to the north and south and left the central and northern portions of the state basking in sunshine. It was the fourth driest July-through-December period in the Northern Sierra since 1923, according to Jan Null, a meteorologist for Golden Gate Weather Services.

Choosing from the half dozen house-made sausages ($9.50/$18/$22.50) and a cheese board ($4.50-$25.50) is a good way to begin. The meats come on a cutting board, without accompaniments. They're good, but the deluxe platter with six kinds became a little monotonous after a while, especially since there's nothing to interrupt the richness, other than sips of wine. If you want something like olives ($3.50) or bread ($4.50), they're extra.

Start by going down several cement steps to the picnic area, then head south. A sign on shore notes that the trail (also known as No. 511) is OK for mountain bikes, but with its sharp turns, trail scree and steep slopes along the water's edge well, it might be entertaining to watch others ride the trail, but I certainly wouldn't want to try it.
Romney won Ohio's primary narrowly, by 10,508 votes in the unofficial count, but he captured more delegates in the state and nationally than any competitor, giving him an edge well before the Republican convention in August. Others in the Republican presidential race say it is presumptuous to assume the former Massachusetts governor will be their party's nominee. Still, he was the Ohio victor, and in winning, he provided a glimpse of challenges he'd face in an election against Obama:

And central libraries, notes Robert McNulty of Partners for Livable Communities, can be "the great good place in the city" -- as a literacy, Internet and special film center, or as a place for lectures, for local performing arts and exhibitions.

The Ripe family's newest and biggest venture has swiftly become its brightest star. Michael and Naomi Hebberoy, founders of the renegade, template-shattering Internet supper club known as Family Supper and the singularly freewheeling Gotham Building Coffee Shop, have teamed with chef/partner Morgan Brownlow to create a whole new way of thinking about what a restaurant can be. And they've done it, despite the industrial-bleak inner eastside surroundings, with a sensuous DIY cool.
The mercury-filled CFL bulbs will still be available, and advanced halogen-incandescent bulbs that meet the new standards are already available. An executive at Philips, which is making the new bulbs, claims that the ban has “created more choice for consumers.”
Kershaw also downplayed the anticipation that the new ownership group might increase payroll at the July 31 non-waiver trade deadline. "It'd be great if it happens," the Dodgers' ace said. "If it doesn't happen, it means we don't need it, which is great too. It doesn't affect me."

The modern room, with an open kitchen backed by a brushed-metal wall, might have looked like something out of "The Jetsons" to a child in the 1960s. Don't despair, contemporary diner. The dishes might sound old-fashioned; the preparations are not. They are interesting, visually appealing, sometimes whimsical and usually delicious takes on what chef/owner Brian Okin calls "creative comfort food." On our first visit, my wife and I went with one of those creations, pigs in a blanket. Verve's version is terrific. In this dish, the "pig" is the best bits from trotters (pig's feet). The "blanket" is a bread-crumb crust. Crispy, deep-fried balls are served with a fruity mostarda dipping sauce and shaved pecorino cheese. Our second appetizer, seared scallops, was also a gem. Sweet, moist scallops were served over creamy polenta. Smoky bacon cubes gave the polenta added flavor and texture. Snapper and mussels was a dazzling, healthful plate consisting of fresh seared fish and steamed mussels on a bed of spaghetti squash with a fragrant beer/ginger broth. Pork and cabbage was, again, nothing like what I remembered -- a generous serving of two bone-in rib chops, nicely grilled and served with a flavorful stuffing of shiitake mushrooms, truffle spaetzel, braised cabbage and buttery bread crumbs.

"Our offense was pathetic," coach Stan Van Gundy said. "And that's something that I've got to take a look at because we've got better players than that. I've got to take a look at what we're doing because it's really two games in a row now where we've been very, very bad offensively."
Longtime Maryland athletic booster Chuck Corcoran said that Anderson inherited a "tough situation" from Yow, who left in June 2010 after 16 years and is now the athletic director at North Carolina State.

Obama was also in Paterson, stopping on a bridge that crosses the Passaic River, which inundated low-lying areas last week. Had he traveled half a mile farther north, to North Straight Street, he might have met Malinda Glover, 38, whose possessions were destroyed. The floors of her apartment were still muddy today, and a brown stain rose three feet evenly up the walls, like a filthy wainscoting. Her refrigerator had been upended by the floodwaters, and the apartment stank of mud and rot.
One possibility is that Lolo was pulling young Barack's leg. Obama's apparent adherence to every nostrum fashionable in the faculty lounge back in the 1980s certainly suggests he's a deeply gullible man.

Now I'm not going to. Now here's the deal, OK. It's not very productive for you and it's not very productive for me. So, I've told you how I govern. I've given you that and we've gone around and around because you've decided emails is the way you get to show I am who I am. We have given you. I have given you on the three issues, how I govern in generic. How I govern in specific and everything I have done. The speed cameras is a piece of legislation in Springfield debated and passed. The water issue is a budget issue that was debated. I introduced it I spoke about it and I am on record. What was the third issue again?

And more often than not, they will definitely grow. For years, the city has selected the Blue Spruce because it's a hardy tree, as opposed to more delicate strains, like the Alberta Spruce.
Add it all up and it shouldn't be surprising how well the Spurs took advantage of such mistakes. After Parker was held last week to two-of-12 shooting because of disciplined pick-and-roll coverage, he scored 29 points Tuesday on 14-of-20 shooting. The Lakers failed to cover perimeter shooters, allowing the Spurs to make seven of 18 from three-point range. And all the Lakers' offensive miscues led to San Antonio scoring 20 fastbreak points.

Cromer also said that he was interested in exploring in more realistic detail the work that the characters do — Mark and Roger's film-making, Maureen's performance art — thus honoring what these young Bohemians are in the East Village to actually do, at least when they are not distracted by love or the problems of the world outside.

Too many kitchen changes, though, have finally taken a toll. From founder Jean-Marie Lacroix to Matt Levin to Jason Cichonski and now chef Jon Cichon, the brilliant concept of this gastro-brunch remains intact. From the raw bar to the creative hors d'oeuvres (Black garlic shoofly pie!) and twists on carving-station classics (Negroni-glazed salmon; Wagyu brisket), there are still many delights. But there were also startling misfires: soggy "chicken-and-waffle" panzanella; a gray blob of rye bread-lobster pudding that shouldn't have seen the light of a $59 brunch.

No. 2 Alabama will play top-ranked LSU (Nov. 5), knocking one of them out. And No. 3 Oklahoma State still has to play No. 9 Oklahoma (Dec 3), in a tough game. And No. 4 Boise State could go undefeated but would still be caught in the BCS numbers game.

When curator Walter Hopps and artist Ed Kienholz opened Ferus in 1957, there was nothing like it along La Cienega Boulevard or, perhaps, in the rest of the country.

When you're Nora Ephron, you can righteously protest the lack of female screenwriters while reaping the benefit of being the best known. You are more than a person, or a writer; you're an intellectual brand, the rom-com, New York Times' Hers-column version of Susan Sontag or Joan Didion, a woman of certain cultural rank. Yes there have been flops, but you wrote "When Harry Met Sally…," so everything that happens to you — aging, the loss of a rent-controlled apartment — becomes worthy of note.

Since that first "gift" at age 30, I've tried every diet available. The grapefruit nightmare turned me into a sourpuss. After drinking ice water nonstop, all I got was brain freeze.

If your LDL and HDL don't improve on your next test, boost the niacin to 1,000 and get re-tested in three months.

This is an ensemble piece, but if the show must have a star, there are two viable candidates. Michael James Leslie provides the booming voice of Audrey II and he provides much more than a voice-over.

The coordination between Leslie's vocal performance and the movements of Audrey II (operated by the unseen Nick Uthoff) are remarkable.

What the ad fails to discuss is that drunken drivers can get drunk on beer or wine, which is already sold in your corner store. If beer and wine weren't already sold at these places, the "no" side might have a valid point. But beer, wine or liquor can get a person too sloppy to drive.

Age shouldn't be the only measure of this movie's appeal. "Away From Her" is leavened by plenty of humor, and set in a slightly surreal landscape where the damnedest things take place. (Keep an eye out for an Alzheimer's patient who used to be a play-by-play announcer.) As is often the case with short stories expanded to feature-film length, Ms. Polley's adaptation is most successful when it stays close to its source material. The tone changes, and the style broadens, in scenes that extend Grant's encounters with a woman, Marian (Olympia Dukakis), whose husband has been a patient in Fiona's care facility. But that's a minor matter in a powerful drama. And, far from being a solo turn by Julie Christie, Sarah Polley's film is a duet that includes -- indeed, depends equally on -- Gordon Pinsent's superb performance as a loving, grieving husband who gives new meaning to the notion of letting go.

Death rates from unintentional injuries of children from birth to age 19 fell by nearly 30% in the United States from 2000 through 2009, largely because of a 41% drop in deaths in car crashes, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday. That amounts to more than 11,000 children saved during the decade, Dr. Ileana Arias, principal deputy director of the CDC, said in a news conference. "The rate is among the worst of all high-income countries," she said, and the real shame is that most of the deaths "are predictable and preventable."
Critics of the Fed have blamed the central bank's loose monetary policies, in part, for the surge in commodity prices and recent rise in global inflation, a contention that Bernanke and others at the Fed have vigorously denied.

"Dark Shadows" — Tim Burton and Johnny Depp are snuggled warmly in their comfort zone in this chilly horror-comedy, their eighth collaboration as director and star, respectively, and their weakest by far. You don't need to know a thing about the "Dark Shadows" TV series that provides the inspiration. Tonally, thematically, visually, you've seen this movie before, with its oddball characters, skies in varying shades of gray and a foreboding sense of gothic mystery. It's actually a wonder that Depp hasn't played a vampire before; still, his long-undead Barnabas Collins, who's been buried alive for nearly two centuries and suddenly finds himself back in his insular Maine hometown in 1972, fits squarely within his well-honed on-screen persona. He thinks he's quite the charmer, but he's actually a bit awkward, and that contradiction provides the main source of humor. Or at least, it's supposed to. The script from Seth Grahame-Smith ("Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter") allows its family full of weirdoes to shine, but too often is crammed with fish-out-of-water gags as Barnabas struggles to make sense of the time in which he's found himself. He struggles to understand modern romance as he courts the family's delicate, wide-eyed nanny (Bella Heathcote) and tries to fit in by smoking pot with the local hippies. Ho ho! "Dark Shadows" feels too languid, and bogged down as it is with an obsessive eye for costumes and period detail rather than offering anything resembling an engaging story. And by the time Burton finally puts his visual effects skills to their best use, in a climactic showdown between Barnabas and the witch who cursed him (Eva Green), it's too late. With Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham Carter and Jackie Earle Haley. PG-13 for comic horror violence, sexual content, some drug use, language and smoking. 116 minutes.

To pay for the new stimulus measures, Obama has proposed a tax package that would more than cover the $447 billion cost, with new revenues totaling $467 billion. The extra money is to provide a cushion for differences in revenue estimates that could crop up as the package moves through Capitol Hill, the White House says.
Although states may initially object to the policy, past precedents have proved that tying financial incentives to state policies can be quite persuasive. The threat of withholding federal highway funding prompted all 50 states to adjust their legal drinking age, and the threat of withholding federal funds for health care would likely have the same effect on vaccination policy.
The outlook for Minnesota's largest companies is a significant indicator of not only the state's economic health, but the nation's as well.

She still attends games there.
A few weeks ago I noticed the bulletin board inside of the Village Square Café at Cross Keys. A welcomed addition to the neighborhood it is. Fewer and fewer bulletin boards are in the ‘hood. They used to be at the front of the library and neighborhood grocery stores. No more.

I have had the unique opportunity to discuss in this week’s Q&A, the recruitment process of a former Rutgers player with his family. Kevin Haslam signed with Rutgers on January 31st 2005 and spent five years on the banks. He was a star offensive tackle at Mahwah High School in New Jersey, as well as a good student. Once at Rutgers he redshirted his true freshman year in 2005 and saw some playing time in 2006, including starting for the injured LT Pedro Sosa in the memorable 20-10 victory over Pitt. In 2007 he earned playing time in all 13 games, including six starts. Over the next two seasons, as one of the team’s most versatile linemen, he started all 13 games in each year, mostly at right tackle. Haslam was a 2009-2010 East-West Shrine participant and was signed by the Jacksonville Jaguars as an undrafted free agent following the 2010 NFL draft. He made the opening day active roster and played in five games as a rookie. Haslam, was well on his way to making the roster and possibly earning increased playing time in 2011 before a knee injury sidelined him for the 2011 season were he spent the year on injured reserve.

It would be less invasive and recovery would be quicker. That's because in a traditional craniotomy the surgeon has to cut a big whole through the scalp, and pull a piece of the skull down.

Mirjam said it was a relief to know that they didn't have to open up her skull and brain and she says the recover was so easy.

In the few well-to-do districts, children are trained from birth to compete, and there are many who volunteer for the games. They're known as "career tributes," or Careers. The poorer districts resort to a lottery, called the reaping, in which the names of the tributes are pulled randomly out of a bowl. The older those eligible are, the more times their names have been entered in the reaping. And in exchange for tesserae, or the equivalent of a year of grain and oil for one person, particularly desperate teenagers can submit their names again, increasing their odds of being picked but also ensuring survival for their families.

In his defense — and let's not forget that his glove has real value at cavernous Coors Field — he's not blocking anyone's path. Are you really going to bail on the 26-year-old Fowler because Eric Young Jr. and Tyler Colvin are having good springs? Makes no sense.
Dance Moms: The girls of the Abby Lee Dance Company are competing for the regional title and a Joffrey Ballet scholarship in the season finale (9 p.m. Lifetime). That's followed at 10:30 by the premiere of spinoff series "Dance Moms: Miami."

But what a promising start. Customers told Jones that they considered most blue cheeses too biting, so he aimed for a more mellow result. He experimented with cultures and with the degree of veining, a feature cheesemakers largely control through adjustments to temperature, humidity and air exposure. Chilling the wheels or cutting off oxygen slows or stops blue-mold growth, but when is the right time to do that?
Dessert is heavenly -- ice cream with apricot compote, accompanied by a flaky cookie twist. The apricots aren't just any apricots, but come from Frog Hollow and are the Golden Sweet variety, a name I'll remember for future farmers' markets forays.
A number of consumers, schools and grocers are shunning beef products that contain the low-cost filler known as "pink slime" as concern about it has grown over the past few weeks.

ø"I don't foresee any situation - even a worsening crisis in Iran - that results in $5 a gallon gas nationally," said Patrick DeHaan of price tracker gasbuddy.com "You're going to see hot spots … that push prices towards $5, but the national range will be $3.75 to $4.15." We don't see a scenario for a national average higher than that for any length of time."

In 2005, commissioners opted to add a nine-story court tower to the project, jacking the price tag to $140 million. Three years later, commissioners changed several specifications, including sidewalks, fire suppression and plumbing.
Such disregard for life, such brutal allegiance to hatred of a particular class of people doesn't happen in a vacuum. Or maybe it does. Perhaps the people who killed these horses were never taught to respect life as children; perhaps they never knew anyone gay growing up. And as we know, demons fill the void for most of us -- demons and fear. It is only through the light of love and kindness that we emerge blinking and squinting into our humanity.
"I want to bring some closure," she said. "I'm confident that I can do it, because I was able to maintain my weight during the Christmas holidays."
The House proposal is not yet formalized in legislation, according to the House Appropriations Committee, chaired by Kentucky Republican Rep. Hal Rogers. The committee member who will ultimately be responsible for that language is Denny Rehberg, a Republican from Montana who oversees appropriations for health and human services. But a Rehberg spokesman was not aware of details concerning the LIHEAP controversy when asked Wednesday.
The first single from Spektor's long-awaited return, "What We Saw from the Cheap Seats," "All the Rowboats" finds her speaking for the paintings hanging in an art museum with a misplaced sense of drama that makes this dark piano ballad all the more intriguing. "First there's lights out; then there's lockup," Spektor sings. "Masterpieces serving maximum sentences/It's their own fault for being timeless/There's a price to pay and a consequence." As consequences go, it's not a bad life for a painting. But Spektor's delivery definitely sells it with passion.
Assets: $13.5 million (2009).
Any rules changes during the owners meetings must be approved by at least 24 of the 32 teams. And there are other proposed changes on the table, including:
"I'm a building designer," she said. "I process projects through the county. In the past, I never had a problem. The people making the biggest complaint are the people who don't want to follow the rules and regulations we've put in place."

Is there anything I can do so I can enjoy the apples and peaches instead of the worms?
There's no doubt three-time All-Pro wide receiver Reggie Wayne will be Andrew Luck's most seasoned security blanket. Fleener will be a close second, given his rapport with Luck as his favorite target at Stanford.
Bonauto urged the judges of the U.S. 1st Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston to strike down this discrimination as a violation of the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law.
Some argue that such retaliation will adversely affect diplomatic and economic goals, especially in relations with our chief cyber adversaries, Russia and China. But if the cyberthreat is as serious as the government says, it must respond concretely when it has decent attribution, and Congress must give the administration the authorities it needs to do so. Events of the past decade have shown that, in the absence of concrete retaliation, complaints and vague threats will only embolden our adversaries.

CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The New England Patriots and Cleveland's old friend, Bill Belichick, find more stars through the NFL Draft than any other team
Kiz: Manning turned 36 years old Saturday. The Broncos gave him a $96 million present. On my birthday, my mom usually sends a card. It's the thought that counts.
Semenko — who grew up in Russia and is fluent in four languages — was arrested hours later by the FBI in one of the largest espionage takedowns in recent U.S. history. His background is among the details that emerged today about three people with ties to New Jersey, who authorities say were part of an 11-member team of Russian agents trying to gradually embed themselves into American businesses and government circles.
Rosemary and Salvatore Cipriano remained in critical condition at Botsford Hospital on Wednesday evening.
In simple terms, it stands for that significant gulf that continues to exist between the candidate and certain pockets of voters: tea partiers, evangelicals, the white working class. It is the Romney Divide that denied the GOP front-runner his chance to finish the race this week, and it remains his biggest liability.
His son, Chris, is also in TV news, as an anchor for "Fox News Sunday."
Nuzzio Begaren at the time claimed that four gang members in an Oldsmobile sedan had been following him from a Burbank Macy's store as he drove with his wife and his 10-year-old daughter from a prior marriage.

Louisiana Democrats want Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal to get into the "Who Dat" fray with the NFL.
By the close of first half, the Browns' defense established that Lynch was not going to win the game. He had 52 yards at halftime and only 30 the rest of the way. Rookie quarterback Trent Edwards was going to have to make some plays, and he could not. The native of southern California had to throw 24 times in the second half and completed only 10.
As soon as a parade of Moroccan-style nibbles at Itz Kosher lands on our table, it's easy to imagine we're sitting in a little cafe in Fez or Marrakech, just outside the central bazaar: a bright carrot salad flecked with spicy harissa, Cabernet-colored pickled beets, cracked cured olives and a fresh cabbage slaw with lemony vinaigrette.
It would be fatuous to say it is better to miss free throws than to make them. Still, the best Cavaliers team before LeBron James -- the only one to win more than one playoff series in one spring, you knew 'em as Mark, Brad, Larry and Hot Rod, the 1991-92 Cavs -- shot 80.5 percent as a team. They were dispatched nonetheless in the conference finals by the Bulls, who had Michael Jordan.

"Classical musicians are notoriously hesitant to change anything," says violinist Kristopher Tong, 30, the Borromeo's youngest member -- who resisted the group's MacBook revolution, defiantly using his laptop to prop up his sheet music for several months in 2007 and 2008. "It looked sort of funny," he says.
We've modernized the recipe a bit - the original called for 15 cups of hot water and 15 bouillon cubes, plus 2 tablespoons of salt - but left all the seasonings and other primary ingredients alone.
in the heart of Old Philadelphia, this houseboat rental is located within walking distance of top attractions including Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell Center.

The 'Khloe & Lamar' star spoke out following the death of a teenager who committed suicide due to bullying.
Whether or not you get a transfer, you always have the question of whether you really want the standard "our next available flight" offer. Maybe you'd rather go back to bed and start over the next day, or scrub the trip entirely if the delay causes you to miss an event. As far as I can tell, most airlines will cooperate with most reasonable rescheduling requests. And if nothing looks good, you can ask your line for a full refund.
Dr. Smoothie and the Teaologist were at the show ... and so were Allergy Chefs Inc. One booth advertised "100 percent compostable, biodegradable, microwaveable, waterproof, oil-proof and non-toxic" tableware. Another promised to "Unleash the Taste."
Kerr said he wants to be clear that his only job is "the bring the maximum number of jobs to the state at a minimum cost to the state." But while his staff must be objective with every possible project, they must also be critical of every project.

Gereb holds out hope that his beloved alma mater joins other colleges and universities that have recognized that a team's branding and packaging hold enormous sway over a 17-year-old's decision about where to play football for one to four years.
By including Jared Jeffries in the deal for McGrady, whose $22.5 million contract expires after this season, the Knicks removed $6.9 million from next season's payroll and left them with about $32 million in salary cap space.

Judge Russo, who is running for re-election and is no relation to the former auditor, said Wednesday night he didn't recall ever taking a call from Dimora or Russo. He said he has no knowledge of his bailiff doing so, either.
With more than two dozen tables on a patio-pier offering views of nearby homes, it's a perfect place to watch a storm roll through or just to sip one of 101 beers ranging from a local Great Lakes ale to a German doppelbock. The design of an indoor-outdoor bar adds to the vibe, creates a nice vantage, and even protects from rain.
"For him, the possibilities of capturing that attention are endless. He's keenly intelligent and has an uncanny ability to perceive his parents' attitudes towards him. He's able to weave these complex justifications for this war he declares."
It's a miraculously sunny winter day. Light filters through the bare trees. We follow the trail - some of it compacted, some boardwalk, and a few muddy patches. It's easy, just enough up and down to give the thighs a nice stretch. Midway, we see the city's pool and realize that we could have parked in an adjacent lot and taken the marked trail at 96th Avenue and West Bowdoin Way.
"In no other composer's music do the tender and the furious coexist so closely -- and in this sonata that idea is extended to tempo: Where the outer movements are meant to quicken the pulse not only of the player, but the listener, life itself slows down for the second movement. Or, if the fast movements grapple with a world which infuriated Beethoven, the slow one imagines a different, more perfect one."
Consumers who have unresolved complaints about DirecTV services, offerings, contracts, fees or prices may be eligible for the refunds.
Prior to those films, Brand was primarily known in his native England as a lewd stand-up comedian whose personal troubles were frequently splashed across the tabloids. Now eight years sober, it took him longer to kick the proclivity for sleeping around that led the English tabloid the Sun to name him "Shagger of the Year" three years in a row. After a stint in rehab at Pennsylvania's KeyStone sex addiction clinic — which he wrote about in his first memoir, 2007's "My Booky Wook" — Brand began living life on the straight-and-narrow. Last October, after a year of dating, he wed pop star Katy Perry at a lavish ceremony in India.
She also played a recurring role on "L.A. Law" and appeared in several episodes of "Cagney & Lacey" as the wife of detective Mark Petrie (played by Carl Lumbly).

"I tend to think because of my position as an AD at a Division I school that spending a full four years is going to benefit almost every player, not just from a football standpoint but walking away with a degree is important in today's world, too," West Virginia athletic director Oliver Luck, Andrew's father, said Wednesday. "The emotional development that comes with completing the cycle with the class that you came in with, I think that last aspect is very special.
Many cartel leaders profess Christian faith and, over the years, have given money to their local parishes, further complicating the relationship between the church and cartels.
A bit later the chants got louder and more frequent.

Health-insurance benefits for attorneys and staff members at beleaguered New York law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP have been suspended for "nonpayment," according to junior lawyers at the firm.
Other cities in Lake are struggling, but none so dramatically as Minneola. Good luck, council members. Too bad sewage plants don't sell well on eBay.
By the way, Casey declined to name a starter against the Ducks, but it would be a mild surprise if it were not Taylor Starr, who has started twice in the past two weeks.
This demure dressing-up is a far cry from the dressed-down black-leather leggings, biker jackets and slouchy tees that had previously dominated so many runways. And it doesn't stop at the catwalk. The "California Design" exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art contains Eames furnishings and a stainless Airstream trailer alongside a draped black 1950s cocktail dress that could have walked any runway in 2011.
Milligan's wife of 55 years, Jeanne, died in 1998.
Residents are prohibited from working on their cars, in most cases, in front of their own houses. Stores that sell spray paint are required to keep it under lock, though graffiti is almost nonexistent. Behind City Hall, there is a "sign jail" full of political ads and business ads that were yanked because they violated Temecula's strict sign rules.
Cars stop. Men get out and look around. They find nothing. They get back into the cars. They drive to the next location. Cars stop. Men get out and look around. This goes on for quite some time. Initially, Ceylan ("Three Monkeys") chooses to tell this tale from a great distance, wide shots far removed from the humans but drinking in the panoramic vastness of the Anatolian night. There is not much light or life in these shots. Eventually he zooms in, taking us tight inside the cars.
The new arrivals would climb up the hill to the Gothic-styled Cathedral de San Juan Bautista (St. John the Baptist) to give thanks for a safe ocean crossing. The original church was destroyed by winds in 1540. Today's cathedral was built in the 19th century.
"That is a fitting end for a person who has caused so much destruction for so many," Duffy said.
Exotic/European. . . . . George Hubbard, 1959 Mercedes 190SL
The room, which UCLA is promoting as "the birthplace of the Internet," is not meant to be a completely authentic historical display. The dimensions don't match the original space exactly, and during the official opening of the site on Oct. 29, Fidler happily allowed a photographer to climb atop the 1960s-era desk to take a picture of the crowd below. That relaxed, slightly improvisatorial approach to history makes the room a good match for a city known for its inherent informality.
And, in the case of Whispbar, the first step in awareness-building will be word-of-mouth advertising. While the product may be quieter and more fuel efficient than its Yakima brethren, it is also about twice as expensive as a typical $200 Yakima setup.
"At its core, it is dishonest, and it must be rejected by the members of this Senate," Sen. Bill Haine (D-Alton) said. "We must find him unfit for this great office."
“Very tough elderly women,” Capt. James Stevens said.
In an apartment, you'll usually get more space than in a hotel room, and you can avoid $20 breakfasts by having them at home -- in bed, if you wish.
Minnery said there is pending federal litigation — the Independence Institute, Jon Caldara et al. vs. Bernie Buescher — challenging many aspects of state rules governing the initiative process. It could result in removing some of the worst thorns, Minnery said.
Tykocinski said Barchi helped lead a “tectonic” shift at the university’s 12-acre campus and found creative ways to boost the institution’s revenue by creating new programs and schools.
Rarely did everything click, but when it did, it was a beautiful thing. Once in every 10 throws, perhaps, I'd hear the whoosh of a proper throw, then stand back and watch as the pole traced a smooth arc in the air.

By passing the expanded ordinance, Pinellas Park joins cities such as Dunedin and Key West.
After seeing the foul called on Baxter, Gary Williams wheeled around and yelled toward the press table, “How bad do you guys want Duke in the final?" Williams screamed in the direction of Mike Tranghese, a close friend of his who was both the Big East commissioner and the chairman of the tournament selection committee.
In a room off the lobby of the W hotel, she removes her glasses and hair clip and tosses both onto a table. She is beautiful, as she has always been, in the remote, masky way a sculpture by Michelangelo is beautiful. Her presence in person feels like the absence of a character. And for this question, she must play the greatest living film actress.
After severing the contract late last month with the beleaguered company that staged the inaugural race, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake's administration has been courting potential successors.

Both sides can point to history to make their arguments.
Today, the underused structure is unlit, encircled in chain-link fence and often covered in graffiti — uninviting to residents looking for a convenient way to cross the five-lane expressway that divides a town planned by renowned developer James W. Rouse, who sought to emphasize connections between its communities.
At last, you got the necessary documentation, got the court order and showed up at the bank.
Mr. Clemens, who is on trial for allegedly lying to Congress about using performance-enhancing drugs, faced potentially devastating allegations from Mr. Pettitte, who pitched with him for years on the New York Yankees and Houston Astros.

“We do expect to make a decision soon as to identifying those who participated in this attack,” Hurley said today. “The detectives have encountered several unique challenges while conducting this homicide investigation.”
"Those guys are going to get chances because they're good," Olczyk said. "But if you have a shutdown line, you're going to try to limit these guys. Then you have to pick your spots on where you want to go from there. It would have to be a strong matchup approach against them at home or on the road. The way that they play, and the type of players they have, to me that would be one way you'd try to exploit them. But they're pretty deep and as long as they continue to get that consistent 'stop and go,' like they have all year, I think the sky is the limit for them."
The Ducks should get a jump start on defending their string of conference titles -- five for the men and three for the women -- in the combined events competition.

So Haywood, a Colorado resident for much of his life, was an actual Red. He made a career out of fighting the mine owners who "did not find the gold, they did not mine the gold, they did not mill the gold, but by some weird alchemy all the gold belonged to them." He claimed that "The capitalist has no heart, but harpoon him in the pocketbook and you will draw blood."

Thus, gift advice. Even though we are paid professionals here on the arts desk, I wouldn't have known about the Led Zeppelin Mini LP boxed set or the 10-DVD "Cult Opera of the 1970s" collection without the handy lists from our critics we've compiled.
Lynne Meadow, artistic director of Manhattan Theater Club, which produced "The Columnist," says Lithgow brings everything you'd want in an actor: experience, collaboration, intellect and passion. "He is the very definition of a leading man. He leads. There's no one in this company who wouldn't follow him. I joke that each season I try to lure him back."

Four of us stare at our menus at the new District on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. "Duck fat Yorkshire pudding," one friend exclaims when she reads the first item. Let's save that for later, I tell her. Why don't we order some biscuits before we decide anything, hmmm? Baked to order, they look adorable snuggled down in a napkin. The Cheddar-flavored biscuits are flaky and a dark gold, with a little jalapeño lurking in the background. I love having them as a course on their own, they're that good.
But both have been short on specifics, and some say that is intentional.
"We will get to their guilt for leaving us," Metcalfe joked at a ceremony Friday at the Old Courthouse introducing MVVA.
Peter and his classmates, seniors at a Roman Catholic boarding school, lead a sheltered, privileged life. But in the throes of adolescence, they aren't sheltered from themselves.
It’s not a stretch to say this wonderful, beautiful season had its origins in Game 80 of 82 last year, a must-have match in which the Rangers went down 3-0 to the Bruins and somehow rallied back against the eventual champs, precisely the kind of grind-it-out effort for which they’ve rightly earned so much praise across this year’s 82.
Dan Ruby, associate director of the Fleischmann Planetarium at the University of Nevada, Reno, said it's unlikely the fireball had anything to do with the current peak of the Lyrid meteor shower.

The city’s goals, after all, are to spend a reasonable amount of money on emergency medical responses while providing timely, high quality care that saves the most lives possible. The standard set by the council and the figures collected by the department need to help the public get answers on how well the city is meeting those key goals.
Q: When do those featured in The Oregonian receive their wishes?
Remember Tom Wolfe's nutty 1975 rant, "The Painted Word," a slim volume claiming that theory had knocked visual experience to the ground and held it down for the count? One could even say that graffiti owes its 1980s emergence into art world consciousness to the success of Conceptual art's frontal assault on formalist Modernism, with its crabbed notion that, say, a painting's highest purpose is to define what a painting is. With an emphasis on words, some Conceptual art even opened the door to thinking of tagging as an artistic strategy.

So can we all please grow up now?
Lionel Rogosin's 1956 film "On the Bowery" is a time capsule in at least two senses: a portrait of a hand-to-mouth existence of a once-notorious New York City thoroughfare, as well as a glimpse into a largely forgotten byway of American documentary film.
"Our greatest triumphs - in America and Ireland alike - are still to come," Obama told the crowd of students, celebrities and families, echoing a message he has delivered to his own domestic constituency during months of recession.

Falk joined the race in January. In the ensuing weeks, the former Dane County executive obtained every major endorsement and the backing of large unions representing teachers and public workers. Still, a Marquette Law School poll released just days before Barrett got into the race showed him leading Falk 36 percent to 29 percent among surveyed voters, but with 17 percent undecided and about even with Walker.

Maria Chagolla had suffered "numerous sharp-force injuries to the head to include both eyes," according to a probable-cause statement filed in superior court.
A second petition has been filed aimed at blocking a light-rail line through Milwaukie. Provided it reaches the ballot and is approved by voters, it not only could jeopardize $5 million in city funding for the project, but also tie Milwaukie officials' hands concerning future maintenance or improvements to the line.
"I do have strong feelings about how government ought to work and protect the environment," she said. "But there's no question that -- right now -- we're playing defense."
I knew if I went down or stopped shooting I was going to be killed. My entire focus at that time was staying on my feet and returning fire. . . . I can remember telling myself, 'Use your sights. Use your sights.' . . . I centered my front sight, center mass, and I squeezed a short burst on full automatic at the man who was shooting at me, and he fell to the ground. . . . I never saw him again, and I don't believe any more fire came from his position.

Cons: Jamie wouldn't know this, but the show has been downsized quite a bit since its 2009 opening, with the live band replaced with recorded tracks and the promise of two "name" stars reduced to just Madison who, while delightful, is not a Broadway-caliber actor and admittedly can't sing. Also, as Jamie noted, the comedic parts of the show turn out to be derived from audience plants.
The multiple-head growth is likely due to some form of damage to the meristem -- externally or internally. This may be due to damage or just a strange form to produce more flowers. There is no discernible problem. I would just enjoy the plant and save the bulbils or pups to see if any of them have the nice grayish new growth as they mature.
Byron LeVan, a pharmaceutical worker in Glendale, got a $150 engine for his bike to save money after he lost his car to his ex-wife. He didn't want to spend $55 a month on a bus pass, a service he considered unreliable.

"This budget contains truths that may not be what you want to hear," Quinn told a joint session of the Legislature gathered in Springfield for his fourth annual budget speech Wednesday. "But these are truths that you do need to know. And I believe you can handle the truth."
Police initially described the incident as a murder-suicide but later backed away from that characterization. Sgt. Bill Balafas said Gilbert police had responded to reports of a domestic dispute and shots fired. When officers arrived, he said, they found four bodies and a mortally wounded young girl. The child died later at a local hospital, he said.
"Honestly, it was probably due to the fact that I've felt for years and years that teams from the St. Louis area had not gotten the respect from the (national) volleyball community like cities like Chicago have," he said.
Nelson's career was built on not conforming to country music norms. He fused country music with jazz and rock in the early 1970s to create the "outlaw country" movement in Austin and helped give the city a reputation as a music city. His first major hit came when Patsy Cline recorded his song "Crazy" in 1961.

The governor had no comment on the decision, said his press secretary, Gil Duran.
When Pritchard goes he'll take another $1 million in salary with him. He'll find another job. So I found myself with a no comment from Allen, left holding that flimsy three-paragraph news release and watching the Blazers play the Mavericks and wondering who it is that I should feel most empathy for.
"It suggests that Atlantic City still has the opportunity to create a positive image," he said.
The problem, according to some critics, is that cheap borrowing costs and buoyant markets make a fertile environment for bubbles, which eventually pop. "The effort to help the economy sets up another more dangerous bubble," says Grantham, who warned of Japan's surging real estate and stock markets in the 1980s, soaring Internet stocks in the 1990s and the housing market in the 2000s.

Senate Republicans next week will try to force the issue by using parliamentary rules to bring up budget plans that Senate Democrats refuse to produce. That exercise in part is designed to embarrass the president by bringing up his budget, which faces near-unanimous defeat. But it will also put senators on record on Ryan's budget, a centerpiece of House campaigns that is under attack by Democrats for the changes it proposes for Medicare.
"The Stamford Police Department's heartfelt condolences go to the family, who are reliving the grief of the loss of their child," he said.

Where has Jack White been all these years? We know the official story — making blues-pop with the Raconteurs, singing Bond themes with Alicia Keys, producing for ex-wife Karen Elson, licensing ferocious mater-ial to crummy ad campaigns. But the White who roasted eardrums with the White Stripes on the “Elephant” album has been curiously MIA; he has been too cheerful, temperate or unfocused to bring the pain with such deranged conviction. On “Blunderbuss,” that White is back, taking berserk inspiration from heartbreak and reclaiming the emotionally raw blues-rock territory he ceded to other artists. He draws inspiration from the same sources he did in his Stripes days: Led Zep, the Doors, the Faces, “The White Album,” classic blues 45s (this set includes a thunderous version of Rudy Toombs’ “I’m Shakin’ ”). He gives the impression that he writes his lyrics in a rush, but he’s a pro at turning out memorable phrases, and has never been more thrillingly acrid than he is here. There’s more piano than Stripes fans might like, but every time he picks up his six-string to solo, he shows why hard, embodied blues will always sound contemporary.

"Come on, has anybody had to go through what we've gone through?" said Bealefeld, who was then two years into the job. He ticked off budget challenges, the fatal shooting of an off-duty police officer by another officer, and the killing of former City Councilman Kenneth N. Harris in a robbery.
Trailing 55-47 at the half, the Sixers outscored Chicago by a remarkable 36-14 in the third, missing just seven of their 22 shots and holding the Bulls to 5-for-20 shooting. Most impressive was the burst of confidence that overcame the Sixers. They beat the Bulls to loose balls, made tough shots in the lane, and fought inside for every rebound. And when Andre Iguodala hit Williams for a backdoor alley-oop that resulted in a wicked two-handed slam, the momentum swing was palpable.

Parnell said Americans can relate to Obama stopping at a burger joint, filling out sports brackets and shopping at Petco with his dog.

Hey, Tony: You've mentioned Colt McCoy's arm strength as a possible concern. I am starting to see that defenses, since they're not afraid of getting beat over the top, are cheating up and jamming the Cleveland running game and intermediate passing routes. Can the Browns scheme around this or at some point do you need a QB with the arm strength to make a D pay for cheating up on him? One more question. I know McCoy is effective on the move, but at some point, don't you have to make throws from the pocket so that you're not always playing on half a football field? That seems to be a limitation, too (but I know the shaky O-line play has been part of this). -- Jeff Biletnikoff, Erie, Pa.
Dressed in their tribal best, the eighth-grade students at Bunker Hill Middle School staged their very own Hunger Games on Wednesday, Feb. 22.

Maryland (16-11 overall, 6-7 Atlantic Coast Conference) was coming off a 27-point loss to the Cavaliers, a game that was tied at halftime before the Terps managed to score only 13 points in the second half.

Your stepson is a victim, in effect. But his mother's not evil - far from it. She's a victim too, of the tremendous peer pressure on today's moms to enter into co-dependent relationships with their kids (and be constantly stressed, anxious, and guilt-ridden as a consequence). The "Good Mommy" standard that has arisen since the 1960s has stripped women of permission to be righteous authority figures in their children's lives. It has transformed the "liberated" woman into a certified Milquetoast Mom.
Variety, which has a paid website, and weekly and daily print publications, is still believed to be modestly profitable, but way down from its peak years.

The LCS is a new type of ship that is meant to improve the Navy's ability to rapidly perform a variety of missions in shallow coastal waters. But the program is hundreds of millions of dollars over budget and has experienced a variety of serious design, manufacturing and operational problems.

The ship also suffered a 6.5-inch crack in its hull while operating in heavy seas.

I feel disgust. That Obama thinks a comedian who has been slammed by Hispanics in the past for his sexist and stereotypical humor and a "Desperate Housewives" star who is currently under fire for coproducing a television show called "Devious Maids" are appropriate conduits to Hispanic voters pretty much says it all.
Meanwhile, the president who runs, or claims to have run, on a specific platform risks over-interpreting the election results. Recall George W. Bush a couple of days after his 2004 re-election. "You asked do I feel free. Let me put it to you this way: I earned capital in the campaign, political capital, and now I intend to spend it," Bush said, citing Social Security and tax reform at the top of his to-do list. The capital turned out to be inadequate to either task.

Here is what I would have told Mr. Rodricks if he had bothered to ask. I don't think we need to make our state the highest income tax state in the nation. I don't think that prospect is something we should be particularly proud of. And I believe that there are more cuts to be made in the budget. Perhaps if you read the budget you might agree that it's unwise to spend tens of millions of dollars in subsidies to the horse racing industry or over $100 million on two mass transit lines that won't be built for decades. Last time I looked, the state is not rolling in cash. More importantly, our citizens are suffering through a serious economic downturn.

The next day, Eva insisted on visiting Valle de Bravo's oldest church, the 17th-century Templo de Santa Maria Ahuacatlan. The cavernous, wood-beamed church is home to the Black Christ, a crucifixion statue said to have miraculously survived a colonial-era fire, emerging unscathed but darkened. Above the statue, now encased in glass and surrounded by plastic flowers, there's a brilliant blue, yellow and orange stained-glass mosaic of a bird in flight.

"This is not time for America to cut and run." Said Obama was wrong to begin reducing troop levels as soon as he did.

Sometimes, they're the ones who bring their parents. But my favorite part of the market is about 5 p.m. when I see the crowd, feel the energy, hear the music. It's just a really neat feeling.

The larger the bank, however, the more difficult it can be for the government to unload it; for example, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. had to manage the failed IndyMac Bancorp for eight months before finally selling it to a private equity group.

So heres the question  if Lidstrom played baseball, football or basketball at the same level that he plays hockey, who would he be? Hes one of the all-time greats. Hes won four championships. Hes been honored for his play with seven Norris Trophies. The Sporting News named him the player of the decade for the first 10 years of this century.

The answer to the question depends not on moralizing interpretations, however, as the social critics want. Having lived in Hollywood for more than a dozen years in the 1980s and '90s, I'm pretty well convinced that urban graffiti doesn't drag down neighborhoods, but instead erupts in areas already largely abandoned by civic forces.

His vocals can bring to mind the expressive growl of Louis Armstrong. His guitar work sounds steeped in the colors of Piedmont blues. And the recordings — most of which he produced himself, up until his most recent one, A Wasteland Companion — sound like ghostly transmissions from some nostalgic alternate honky-tonk universe. He's covered tunes by the underappreciated outsider songwriter/singer Daniel Johnston. He's done Beach Boys tunes. He's recorded a haunting version of J.S. Bach's "Prelude and Fugue in C Major." He can veer from songs that would be equally at home on Tom Waits or Carter Family records. He's probably best known for his collaborations with the actress Zooey Deschanel. (They record under the name She and Him.) He's also recorded with the Monsters of Folk, which includes Jim James of My Morning Jacket and Conor Oberst of Bright Eyes. Point is, he's all over the map, and yet it's all somehow filtered through his expansive sensibility. But of all the artists that M. Ward conjures, the Beatles don't immediately pop out as an obvious influence to a listener. And yet the Beatles, it turns out, put a major stamp on everything M. Ward does.

But I didn't stop there. I added thick-cut smoked bacon, chopped in large chunks, to the mix -- because when you're grinding your own meat, you can add whatever you want. Then I ran it all through the grinder a second time, to tenderize the meat further. The whole process took less than 10 minutes, much longer than necessary because I stopped periodically to take photos and to exclaim, "This is so cool."

The difference between being liked and being loved seems especially clear in the collection's title essay, which is also its best.

Franzen writes bitterly of Wallace's death, calling it an act "calculated to inflict maximum pain on those he loved most" and, later, a choice "to leave the people who loved him and give himself to the world of the novel and its readers."

But a disruption of the vital Persian Gulf chokepoints — the Abqaiq processing plant in eastern Saudi Arabia, the Ras Tanura terminal on the Saudi Arabian coast, or the two-mile-wide sea lane of the Strait of Hormuz — would be devastating. If one, two or three of them is hit by terrorists flying hijacked jumbo jets or shut down by Iranian military action, as much as 40 percent of all seaborne oil will be stopped, as much as 18 percent of all global supply will be interrupted, and more than 10 percent of the U.S. supply will be cut off. Estimates on the U.S. shortfall suggest the percentage lost could be far higher. Repeat attacks, and the difficulty of anti-mine operations in a hostile environment, could prolong the crisis for many months — which is exactly what al-Qaeda and the Iranian regime have promised. Yet, apparently, there is no government plan.

More than that, the film so audaciously piles on a series of shameless, head-shaking contrivances and is so happy to milk them for all they're worth that it starts to feel like, heaven help us, a mixed martial arts version of "The Help." Yet, like that venture, "Warrior" is genuine in its pursuit of what it considers to be a resonant narrative and its two-hour, 19-minute length is a testament to how seriously O'Connor takes its story.
Brian, who managed the family's shoe store alongside his father, doesn't believe the family will find closure through an arrest. But Brian believes getting the killer off the streets would help the healing process.

I couldn’t get enough of Dlugoss’ Asian beef short ribs ($21). They are comfort food with an exotic flair, if that’s not a complete contradiction in terms. Two very large, falling-apart-tender short ribs are bathed in a savory, soy-inflected ginger-hoisin reduction, served alongside the most fabulous jasmine rice, fragrant and almost creamy. Steamed whole baby bok choy adds color and crunch, balancing the plate perfectly.

Swift kicks this off with a chorus of "Living on a Prayer." Really. It's not as horrible as it sounds. Then it's back through the crowd to the main stage, where she discharges this one better than she did last year.

Like pain, itchiness varies greatly from one person to another, and is difficult to convey. Both are also devilishly resistant to treatment, and both are clearly exacerbated by stress.

The Republican "establishment machine" has lined up behind Mitt Romney, but can Romney beat President Barack Obama in the general election? That answer is no!

To date, ultrasonic transmitters have been implanted into more than 160 fish (below the barrier, both Asian carp and surrogate species are tagged; above the barrier, only surrogate species are tagged), with about another 40 fish to be tagged this the summer. Thirty-two stationary receivers collect tracking data from the tags, supplemented by mobile tracking to identify the locations of the tagged fish. Tags also were implanted into small surrogate species (2.1 inches to 7.5 inches) and released directly above and below Barrier 2B in order to assess barrier efficacy on smaller sizes of fish. We have more than 1.2 million detections from the tagged fish that indicate none has crossed any of the electric barriers. The same data also indicate that common carp are able to navigate the Lockport, Brandon Road and Dresden Island locks and dams.

I did not realize this at the time, but only in hindsight understood that this unkind life's wound set him apart from all of our traditional nuclear families and set up ridicule and fear within our class. We immediately began to tease him a lot, and called out, "Vans!" quickly if he happened to brush against us or if we were to touch him. "Vans!" to redeem us from being tainted by his "germs". I don't remember that he had many friends, though I recall that he still kept up smiles in spite of the taunting.

Sprouting also causes some trace minerals, such as zinc, to be "freed up," or released, from the bran of the wheat kernel, says Rooney, who is also a spokesman for the Institute of Food Technologists.

That sort of politics has less to do with adequate representation for a community of interest than it does with whether the process itself is being engineered to ensure that particular seats are crafted for particular candidates who are supported by particular incumbents.

Two shots of rum. A splash of Curacao. And a set of puckered lips. As legend has it, that's what happened when saloon mogul "Trader Vic" Bergeron designed the mai tai in 1944. The drink turned the Trader Vic's bar chain into a smash and marked the explosion of the summer cocktail culture. More than six decades later, tiki culture is a drink some would say has been watered down to resemble anything "islandy" -- in other words, too much Jimmy Buffett and not enough Polynesia. Well, Bahama Breeze manages to make that new "tiki" concoction tasty, thanks to the drinks it serves. The joint has the casual Caribbean-meets-Hawaii-and-other-island-getaways vibe. But it's the drinks that pucker lips. Sure, it does a nifty Mojita Cubano. But the Bahamarita is a must -- especially if you love fermented fruit salads. Imagine gulping down the mix of kiwi, mango, strawberry, other fruits, tequila and schnapps. I'm usually not into these kinds of potions. But somehow, the Bahamarita -- chased by an Ultimate Pina Colada (Captain Morgan's Original spiced rum and Coco Lopez swirled with strawberry ice and topped with Myers's dark rum) -- made me see palm trees and hear steel drums. Oh, wait, that's the decor and guy in the corner playing Caribbean versions of rock tunes.

Almost two decades later, their music once again makes me want to be in a band.

In one script, the commercial begins with a shot of a pitcher throwing batting practice. His pitches are hammered, streaking out of the ballpark, but doing so with odd sound effects. Instead of the crack of the bat, there's a sproing! or a thwack! or a wibblywonnngggg! or some other Seussian sound. The camera pans into the cage to see Matt Holliday (or another hitter, perhaps Berkman, depending on availability) holding a 2-by-4. David Freese hands him a shovel and Holliday tosses the 2-by-4 "into a pile that includes an umbrella, golf club, Wiffle ball bat, and a cane."

We are confident Democratic lawmakers, who hold lopsided majorities in both houses, will never dock their own pay, no matter how out of balance their budgets, and despite the promise of Prop. 25.

But something is dirty in Dirt, possibly the mayor (Ned Beatty), a wheelchair-bound tortoise who sounds a lot like John Huston in "Chinatown" when he says: "Control the water, and you control everything."

Just as the Secret Service trails the president at all times, New Jersey's governors are constantly protected by a state police detail.

Jon Corzine, who Christie defeated in 2009, personally paid for use of helicopters to travel the state.

I find generally that even though we're as busy as we've ever been, we enjoy ourselves a lot more. Everyone seems to be comfortable but excited to be doing this. Based on that alone, I very much look forward to keeping on.

The teachers union has been offered a chance to help make the draft legislation better, and it should do so. It will be much easier to negotiate with a mayor who wants what's best for the city, its schools and, above all, its children, than it will be to negotiate in the legislature, once the bill starts down that road.

The butter for guns swap faces a veto threat from the White House and rejection by the Democratic Senate, which say the GOP measure unfairly hits the middle-class and the poor.

Tuesday's federal court ruling declaring Proposition 8 unconstitutional can be easily explained: There is no legitimate government interest in prohibiting same-sex marriages.

Express Scripts could have built its latest facility in Philadelphia, but chose to remain in St. Louis County, generating $123 million in economic development and 270 high-paying jobs. So, too, was the case for Edward Jones. Its expansion plans could have taken it to Tempe, Ariz. Instead it expanded here, creating a $325 million investment and 1,000 quality jobs (over five years). Other companies, including Covidien, Scottrade, Panera Bread and Shattdecor, selected the county for their expansion plans. The list goes on.

Such a huge drop in price would certainly increase use. But no one knows by how much because no modern country has experienced prices that low. Taxes could not come close to maintaining prohibition-level prices without being undercut by a "gray" market. Indeed, tobacco-tax evasion is already a serious issue in the U.S., where the average state tax is a few dollars a pack, and a pack of cigarettes weighs just about an ounce. By comparison, an ounce of high-quality marijuana now sells for about $300.

The Skinny: Kentucky gets another crack at the Hoosiers, who beat them on a last-second 3-pointer by Christian Watford in December.

Like Rickey, Stengel was larger than life, gruff, unorthodox. And like Robinson's arrival, the Mets came into being out of a Rickey plan to open up professional baseball, in this case by creating a third major league. Breslin doesn't deal with that in his new book (the league never got off the ground, but Rickey's attempt led to expansion), but he does make the case for Rickey as a visionary.

The O's need to win because they shouldn't go home 5-5 after starting out 5-2. They need to win because they should not have looked so much like the 2011 midseason Orioles on Saturday night. They need to win because Angels starter Dan Haren is beatable and a 6-4 finish on the trip would be uplifting while a 5-5 finish (which would leave the O's with a .500 overall record) would be a big letdown.

So just in case Sennett woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning, here's proving that Lewis' former(?) bandmate can do the solo thing, too. The Elected became a creative outlet for the guitarist when Jenny Lewis's prolific songwriting crowded his compositions out of Rilo Kiley's albums. "Greetings in Braille" isn't the best song he wrote for his side project, but it's one of the few that shows up on the Internet (Jenny Lewis is all over YouTube, and deservedly so.)

NEXT BIG THING
Meanwhile, St. Louis County is moving ahead with plans for a $2.1 million study - announced earlier this year - on best ways to re-use the plant.

It's easy to be negative. (In fact, that's actually the official slogan of Sunday Spin.) To put a positive face on what the Browns didn't do at wide receiver requires a belief in the current group of pass catchers and even more trust in the Browns' talent evaluators. That makes it doubly difficult because of what we've seen in the past two seasons.

For perspective, a single abdominal CT scan provides a patient with the radiation equivalent of approximately 400 chest x-rays. Interaction of radiation particles with human DNA results in sometimes permanent genetic changes. These interactions are cumulative over time and disproportionately affect the sensitive tissues of younger people, resulting in deleterious effects on the body, such as cancer. Thus, the result of the over-radiating of the American public may not be known for years.

During the 2008 presidential campaign, the National Rifle Assn. spent millions of dollars on political ads claiming that Democratic candidate Barack Obama was out to take Americans' guns away; one typical ploy was an NRA website, called GunBanObama.org, whose banner headline read, "Obama would be the most anti-gun president in American history." In the wake of Obama's election, gun sales soared and ammunition prices skyrocketed as consumers stockpiled bullets in preparation for a war on gun rights that never happened.

CH: My favorite research task was discovering what happened to Abner Joslin, the first principal of PS # 14 in 1869. He retired in 1913 and showed up on the 1920 census as living with his niece in Oxford, MA. Unable to learn any more, I contacted the city of Oxford and the Oxford Historical Society, since Mr. Joslin's nephew was a pioneer in diabetes research and the family is very important in the town's history. The people in Oxford were so kind; they actually sent a crew to the town cemetery to get his birth and death dates from the tombstone for use in the book.

Yet as initiations go, Wieland's first major-league inning was like a pledge paddling by a fraternity of football players. He faced only five batters before pitching coach Darren Balsley jogged to the mound for a consultation, yielded four runs before recording his second out, and succeeded in achieving a dubious statistical oddity - an eight-batter inning in which he retired the side without lowering anyone's batting average.

BEIJING -- Ford's China strategy is based on four new SUVs, as that segment gains traction in the world's largest auto market, and it will build at least two of them locally, executives said at the Beijing auto show.
In thinking about this question, I tried to ignore the fact that the parents seemed less than attentive (or, said another way, dumber than a bag of hammers) by not addressing their child's needs for comfort and entertainment during a cross-country flight.

Potential cuts: And players who might be traded. In this case, we mean RB Brandon Jacobs and DE Osi Umenyiora.

The language of amendments being considered this year would create a particularly difficult situation as they require spending be limited to 18 percent of gross domestic product.

The American writer-director Stuart Cooper made "Overlord" in 1975, but only now has his remarkable film, set in England during World War II, been given an American release. (Operation Overlord was the Allied invasion of France.) Even before the action starts, the film announces its singularity with the very first title: "The Imperial War Museum Presents."

(And shot superbly, in evocative black and white, by the late John Alcott, Stanley Kubrick's favorite cinematographer, whose specialty was making powerful images with the simplest possible lighting setups.)

Situated on Pleasant Valley Road, Christie is in a good neighborhood, with excellent Pinot Noir from the nearby Lester vineyard (once called Deer Park) and several other sites, many of them planted by Foxx. A couple of miles away is the Woodruffs' vineyard, with its 7 1/2 acres of 30-year-old Pinot Noir and terraced Chardonnay vines - ancient by most California standards. The deeply rooted vines are farmed without irrigation; that can yield less than a ton per acre in vintages like 2011, but also creates complex and nuanced wine.

During Meyer's six years at Florida, his 65-15 record represented the second-most wins among major conference teams. The only program with more on-field wins was Ohio State at 66-12, though Ohio State's 12-1 record from the 2010 season was vacated by NCAA sanctions. Those NCAA issues started with several players exchanging memorabilia and cash for tattoos, continued through Tressel's unethical conduct charges for not revealing his knowledge of that situation, and increased through violations over $200 booster payments to three players and overpayment for summer jobs.

I'm optimistic that news organizations like The Bee will survive and thrive, simply because they're providing the detailed reporting and analysis unavailable anywhere else. But it's been tough watching this paper and others lose so many great reporters and editors as they've cut back over the past few years. And I'm troubled by the increasing political polarization in our society, which I think is at least partly the result of fewer people reading newspapers and instead turning to alternative media outlets that just confirm their own biases.

Insert a meat thermometer in the thickest part of the tenderloin and be sure the thermometer is not hitting an oven coil. Remove the meat when the temperature is 8 to 10 degrees less than the temperature desired, as it will continue to cook once removed. It will take approximately one hour to sear and bake a 4-pound beef tenderloin in the oven. We tend to cook our tenderloin to approximately 140 degrees for medium, and 135 degrees for medium-rare. Remove the meat from the oven or grill and let rest uncovered for 10 minutes. The temperature will rise and the juices from the meat will redistribute. Slice in -inch-thick pieces and pass the sauce of your choice separately.

Finally, Gerry thought, why not just keep making our old monthly mortgage payment? By tacking an extra $395 principal payment onto our $805 monthly mortgage nut, we'd shave six years off our 20-year loan term and save $16,535 in interest. Once the mortgage is paid off, another $1,200 a month, or $14,400 a year, would be available to help pay Gerald's college costs.

A troubling recurring thought comes to mind: if there was still a ‘draft,’ would a mounting chorus of protests have become overwhelming enough to cause an entirely different set of circumstances to develop? But because wearing a uniform is a choice, putting one’s life on the line a personal decision, have we in reality become detached - less involved as citizens – enjoying our Independence Day holiday without much thought given to its meaning and its page in history?
Rivera, who has been held out of the lineup for the last five games because of a strained hamstring, popped up to shortstop Troy Tulowitzki in shallow left field.

There are legitimate questions to be asked and the only way to ask them with any force is to employ a special prosecutor to investigate and determine whether Mason ignored evidence of widespread criminal wrongdoing under his watch or even participated in the culture of corruption. It seems likely that the federal authorities might be asking these questions, but unless Mason is secretly cooperating with the feds and his beneficial contributions to that investigation will be explained at the end of the process, he appears to be cloaked with a Teflon shield that is insulating him from serious consequences.
Andrzej Fonfara was left stranded here in 2006 when the Polish boxing promotion that had signed him to a pro contract as a teen sent him to Chicago for a fight and promptly went belly-up. Stung once, the young Fonfara and his family rationalized he had a better chance of making it in the cutthroat boxing business in America than he did back home.

In fact, it is for Mo-Chica, the lunch counter near USC, that Zarate was named one of the best new chefs in the country last year by Food & Wine. When Roy Choi left a high-paid job as an executive hotel chef to grill Korean tacos on a food truck, his cooking reached people in a way that it never could have at the Beverly Hilton. He too was honored by the magazine. When former l'Orangerie chef Ludovic Lefebvre, a protégé of revered French chefs Alain Passard and Pierre Gagnaire, became obsessed with American fried chicken during one of the runs of his pop-up restaurant LudoBites, he spun off a fried-chicken truck that often sees lines wrapping around the block.

Hey, Tony: I watched a little of the Lions game and was amazed to see a QB who could throw and receivers who could catch. I was so envious. I wouldn't mind if the Browns would just show up, but they are unprepared, seem to have no game plan and no discipline. I am 63 years old, have been a life-long fan and people who know me know I love the Browns. But I am worn out. Any advice for a truly depressed fan? -- Debbie Badonsky, Kettering, Ohio

"Melancholia" the film is beautiful. Melancholia the planet is beautiful; the light reflected off it makes the night beautiful, as well. Pay attention to the sound of the film -- not just the use of "Tristan und Isolde," but the growing drone as Melancholia draws closer. The climax of the film is a form of sensory overload, piling on until the audience, and the planet, can take no more.

It got more convoluted when he asked my political affiliation. “It depends,” I told him. Some years I vote Democrat. Some years I vote Republican. He hesitated. I sensed that his questionnaire couldn’t cope with voters who refuse to be tied to one party. That’s too bad, especially since the Republican Party has unofficially split, with tea party types often sniping at moderates. To say I vote Republican hints that I’m a tea party backer. I’m not, I stated clearly, but I wonder what the pollster wrote down.

Then, after only one season on "Charlie's Angels," Fawcett decided she wanted out of the show that had made her a global icon. Whether she was doing it out of ego and ambition, or because she felt the workload (and popularity) of "Angels" was hurting her marriage to Majors, the move backfired.

Note on adding color: Macarons taste delicious whether colored or not. In order to minimize moisture content, Tian uses powdered food coloring, which may be found at craft or specialty-food stores or ordered from online sources such as amazon.com or chefrubber.com. Because the strength of the food coloring varies depending on the brand, you may have to experiment. For making yellow shells for the Meyer Lemon Curd Filling, Tian recommends using 1/8 teaspoon yellow powdered food coloring; for rose macaron shells, she suggests 3/8 teaspoon red and 1/16 teaspoon blue powdered food coloring. Coloring is a matter of personal preference. Use more or less as desired; and expect the white meringue to dilute the color considerably. I made lovely rose macarons with only red coloring. If you can't find powdered food coloring, try gels, which contain less water than traditional food coloring.
Binkley's final dinner touch, a fanciful spoonful of sansho, will send you home quivering. It's a spicy Japanese seasoning that comes from the berries of the prickly ash tree, dried and ground into a powder. (It's related to the fiery Sichuan pepper.)

The suit in Washington was brought by the American Center for Law and Justice, a legal group founded by evangelist Pat Robertson. It claimed that the insurance mandate is unconstitutional because it forces Americans to buy a product for the rest of their lives and that it violates the religious freedom of those who choose not to have insurance because they rely on God to protect them from harm. But the court ruled that Congress had the power to pass the requirement to ensure that all Americans can have health care coverage, even if it infringes on individual liberty.

I won't get into the pros and cons of premium support either, other than to note that The Times' editorial board has praised the version proposed by Ryan with Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.)

IF THE clothes make the leading man, Luke Wilson is angling to play the handsome high school lit teacher -- you know, the one who made you cry when he read aloud from "A Separate Peace." He rarely veers from his Kennedy-era haircut and typically shows up at events in rumpled khakis or cords and a preppy blazer. Then, there's that squint. More musing than macho, Wilson has perfected a studied squint -- or is it a wince? -- that precedes his answers to the tough questions.

I love the Internet, particularly when I have to learn something new to address the letters that get printed in response to one of my letters and when I have to check Frank's ramblings for accuracy. While I don't think I spent a long time talking about Wisconsin and Scott Walker, Mr. Sorce seems to want to make the case for moving to the Great State of Wisconsin, particularly under the administration of Mr. Walker. I would rather refer to the local paper, in this case the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, to find out what is really going on there. In a Jan. 22, 2012 edition an article discusses the fact that the Wisconsin State Administrative Secretary wrote to the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services and stated that Wisconsin would have "an undisclosed deficit" from January 1, 2012 until June of 2013. How is that so, Mr. Sorce, when you state Gov. Walker eliminated the deficit and created a surplus? Well the article goes on to say that Gov. Walker claimed to have eliminated the deficit, but he was using a long-used budget trick that did not use valid accounting methods and if those more accurate methods were used (and Mr. Walker campaigned on the platform that he would use the more accurate accounting procedures) they would show Wisconsin was and will be running a budget deficit of $3 billion for 2012-2013. Mr. Sorce was also cheering Gov. Walker's job creating skills; but hold on there. In a July 21, 2011 article from the same source it was noted that unemployment rose from 7.4 percent to 7.6 percent and that most of the jobs "created" under Gov. Walker's programs were jobs in tourism, hospitality service and food service; jobs that are usually temporary, low-paying and carry few if any benefits.

I think that the Timbers Army will grow. There may be one or two (groups). But it's not a supporters' group if it's not 100 active people, in my mind, at least. That's the minimum threshold. We'll do some things to try to facilitate, but the great thing about the army is it's really been organic in how it's grown. The only thing that I've done is really try to improve relations with the Timbers Army. And that wasn't the case with past management. And we'll continue to do that with MLS.
In a bleak assessment that added urgency to the president's speech, the White House budget office on Thursday predicted that without new polices unemployment will remain at 9 percent next year. It also projected overall growth this year at just 1.7 percent, a full percentage point less than the administration predicted at the beginning of the year. On the other hand, the budget office review said that the projected deficit for the year ending Sept. 30 will be $1.3 trillion, $300 billion less than it projected in February.

The first looked overthrown from the moment it left Weeden's hand, but Blackmon used every ounce of speed to catch up to a ball thrown from midfield to the end zone. On the second deep pass, the wind seemed to move the ball around a bit, but Blackmon adjusted at full speed and hauled it in.

It's not clear why estrogen, which is known to fuel the growth of breast cancer cells, would work to lower risk in some women. Some research suggests that when estrogen levels begin to decline during menopause, small tumors in the breast adapt and begin to grow at the lower concentration. When estrogen levels are boosted again through replacement therapy, the tumors may stop growing.

"To make matters worse, we discovered the bank that took over ours charges a $30 annual maintenance fee when an IRA owner has less than $10,000 in the bank. This fee was clearly spelled out in the terms we received from the new bank. We failed to read them because we assumed they would be similar to those of the old bank. The result is that my wife would have lost money with the IRA because the maintenance fee would have been more than the interest she earned. Fortunately, we discovered the problem before the $30 was due and my wife was able to transfer the IRA money to another institution without penalty.

ANSWER: Yes, I collect pinball machines, and I have about 74 of them. About 18 are at home and the rest are in storage. It's just been a part of my life for so long and I really enjoy it. I have pinball machines that span 70 years, and I recently bought 27 more that I can fix up and take to next year's expo. It's funny because every pinball machine is kind of like its own universe. The ones for the expo come from me, members of the Detroit Pinball League, as well as places like Ye Olde Saloon in Royal Oak and Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum.

Neighborhood patrols serve a valuable purpose, and Shomrim, the organization to which Eliyahu Werdesheim belonged at the time, has long been lauded for its efforts in Northwest Baltimore.

Usually what you see when a new mayor comes in, the police chief goes and the fire chief goes and a lot of the department heads. I understand that. If you're not a good fit then the mayor has every right and should replace you with somebody else. So the new mayor will decide. I would stay if I was asked to stay.

The more pertinent fact: Luck and RGIII are gone. Tannehill is overpriced. Weeden's age, if anything, deflates his value and that could work in the Browns' favor. They're in a great position with the number of picks they have and the amount of quarterback expertise they have on staff to be bold in this draft and find a better answer than they currently employ.

There may come a day when asking people whether they are gay is as innocuous as asking where they live. But we're not there yet. The revelation of a judge's sexual orientation continues to spark controversy (as in the case of former Chief U.S. District Judge Vaughn R. Walker, who heard the Proposition 8 case), and questions about people's private lives are not yet routine.

Chavez's good pal Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is going through some difficulties of his own. The Iranian president, whose own hate-filled speeches have triggered walkouts at the U.N. -- as when he said most people blame Washington for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks -- is gradually losing power. The ayatollahs who helped him retain the presidency after the protests that followed the disputed 2009 election have had enough of Ahmadinejad. He got too big for his britches, and now the turbaned ones want him out. He may or may not stay in office, but he has lost much of his power.

7. HONOR GUARD: The highest honor that a baseball person can achieve greeted Whitey Herzog in July, and the highest honor a civilian can receive was awarded Stan Musial this past month. Herzog, the Cardinals' beloved manager, was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame this past year. Musial will receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom in February. Both honors illustrate the power of persistence. Herzog had an influential group of Hall of Famers and decision-makers pushing for his induction through the years. Musial had Cardinals Nation. As part of their desire to increase the franchise's social-media footprint, the Cardinals rolled out the "Stand for Stan" campaign on Facebook, Twitter and the team's official Web site. That goosed politicians to again remind the White House of Musial's contributions to the country and his place as a civic icon in St. Louis. With both campaigns having been successful, it will be interesting to see what unifies the masses next. Retire 51? A number for Medwick? Or, a New Year's Day NHL game at Busch Stadium III?

Fifty years ago, America was just waking up to the reality of environmental pollution: Rachel Carson had published Silent Spring, heralding the modern environmental movement and raising America's consciousness about the impact of DDT pesticide use on the environment and public health. Then, in 1969, Cleveland's Cuyahoga River caught fire due to the oil-soaked debris consuming it, and the country's then-largest oil spill occurred in Santa Barbara, California. The culmination of these events inspired the call for a national day promoting environmental education and lead to the creation of the first Earth Day on April 22, 1970.

The proposed constitutional amendment — which would have to pass the Legislature and be approved by voters statewide — is modeled after Proposition 2½, adopted by Massachusetts voters in the 1980s.

We'll never know if their mythic quest might have made an accessible movie, for this one offers characters as bleak as its setting -- the sole exception being Michael Caine in a role one size larger than a cameo -- and makes a murky cipher of the plot.
